### New Jan 2021

Happy New Year. Thanks for all the support all year. We appreciate it. Sadly, we were unable to perform any shows. We hope this will change and there are some scheduled for 2021, but we will have to be patient and see if any of them are possible. Dr Space is trying to raise money for his studio, and there is a ØSC rarities CD up for sale. Limited to 120 copies (for sale, 150 made). Thanks.. 

In 2021, you can expect another subscriber CD, a subscriber-only LP, a new studio album, and finally, *Sleeping with the Sunworm* will come out on vinyl!
