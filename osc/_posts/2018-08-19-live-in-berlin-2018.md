### Tour Details:
In May and into early June, ØSC toured with Black Moon Circle, performing in 9 concerts across 5 countries. The last concert of the tour was in Berlin, where ØSC had never performed before. Despite competition with Roger Waters, the concert attracted around 100 attendees and was a spectacular end to the tour. A multitrack recording was made, and the final mix was done by Jonathan Segel, the band's guitar/violin player.

The show took place at Urban Spree, Berlin, on Saturday, June 2nd. The entire band was on fire, with incredible performances from the musicians, including mind-blowing guitar solos by Vemund and an epic synth solo by Mogens. The rhythm section, Tim and Jiri, also delivered killer performances on drums and bass.
