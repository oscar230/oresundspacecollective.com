  </strong>
  <p><strong>The Players: Dr. Space, Mogens, Tobias, Magnus, Michael, S&oslash;ren,
      Anders, Johan, Jesper, </strong></p>
  <p><strong>18:00</strong> Johan and I head over to Dragens Hule. Mogens and a
    couple of guys are there. It does not look much different than when I left last
    night. Mogens was going to set up his stuff and clean up a bit but I guess that
    party with Sonja and Magnus went on after I left. No big deal. We head up to
    Magnus&#8217;s place upstairs and they are making food. S&oslash;ren, Michael,
    Magnus and Sonja. Leek soup with cheese and bread! Smelled good. We hang out
    up there until 19 and then we all go down and set up. Tobias has arrived from
    Sweden as well now and so has Thomas. Everyone is in a really good mood. </p>
  <p><strong>20:00</strong> We had a pretty good soundcheck and the monitor sound
    is good on stage now. We just need to get the over all sound in the room with
    sound in the PA ok and then we will be ready to fly. It is pretty relaxed. Johan
    and I are alone here as Kasper and Henrik (Who will work the bar) and Mogens
    have gone to get some food. We just chat and hang out. Projector is looking
    great so we will be ready to fly for sure! I really wonder how many people will
    show up???</p>
  <p><strong>22:00 </strong>We just had a soundcheck and some of the Swedish people
    are here, Nils and his friends. The mushroom Ice tea from Sweden is here as
    well from Stojs and Palle. About 20 people here now. We just had the soundcheck
    jam and that was really cool. Wish I had recorded that. I think Stojs recorded
    5-10 mins of it. Steen has arrived to video tape the show as well. </p>
  <p><strong>24:00</strong> Wow.. the first set was a trip, a little more than an
    hour and some really cool and heavy and spacey and jazzy stuff. Mogens and I
    are trippin&#8217; a bit. It was cool. Everyone said the sound was really good.
    I could hear great where I was but was really sensitive to the sound and what
    was going on. Anders on the sax really is cool but he throws me off sometimes
    and he was having a lot of sound problems and really make this abrupt sounds
    and feedback at times before he got it all sorted out. It is very hard from
    him to play with some much sound and loud&#8230; I think we played about an
    hour.</p>
  <p><strong>02:00</strong> Ok.. the place it totally wacked out with people laughing
    and tripping their brains out now. This set had the return of Michael on bass
    with S&oslash;ren and that was awesome. Some super heavy grooves. Johan was
    suppose to play guitar but he was feeling too strange to play from the mushrooms
    so he will wait until the 3rd set. I was coming down now but still in a strange
    state. Beginning of this set was mind blowing. Set was 71 minutes. </p>
  <p><strong>03:30</strong> Wow..what a mess that was. We tried to have a third
    set. Thomas was suppose to play the bass but was passed out upstairs and his
    bass was falling apart. Strings falling off, broken knobs, etc.. Not sure what
    the hell happened! We had to borrow Michaels. Jesper from Gas Giant played drums,
    mogens on bass, Johan on guitar to start and Magnus on synths. It was insane
    stuff. Mogens and Jesper could not play anything together and were all over
    the place. Johan and I had to give up as it was impossible to play with them.
    Johan switched to bass when Mogens gave up, Tobias came on guitar and then Magnus
    played guitar and now something happened and we played a super heavy jam for
    5-10minutes. I had already turned some of my synths off but came back on to
    play this killer groove. That was it for us&#8230; Magnus and Jesper played
    some stuff with a friend Kenneth on hand drum for 5 minutes but only like 10
    people were left now and it was insane. </p>
  <p>Crazy fucking night! So was mushrooms a good or bad idea??? Good for the audience
    but bad idea for the band&#8230;. Never again before we play&#8230; I hope the
    recordings are good!<br>
