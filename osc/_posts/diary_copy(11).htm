# Øresund Space Jam, København May 14th, 2005

![Dairy Button](IMAGES/BOTTONS/DAIRY.jpg)

This was a pretty amazing session with 3 sometimes 4 synthesizer players. Everyone was in a really good spirit and Mogens had a new toy in the Novation X-Station and Sabana had a new Fender 2004 Stratocaster. We had 3 jams for a total playing time of almost 3 hours and 20 minutes. I managed to get the guitar players to turn up and they play awesome stuff. It is a really cool psychedelic soup this session with amazing sound! Enjoy.....

I have also included some CD artwork for the session and some good pics of the band but none of myself as I am the one with the camera!
