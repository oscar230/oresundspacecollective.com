# Øresund Space Jam, Black Tornado Studio, København July 15th, 2005

We arrived at the studio at 12 and started to load in the gear. Everyone was there except for Mogens who had to work until 3-4. It took a long time to get all the gear set up, mics, headphones for 8 people and the sound so we could just jam. It was 15:30 when we had the first jam. It was quite strange to have us all jamming when people were totally straight (not yet high!). Despite a lot of people not hearing each other, it was a very cool first jam piece. The sun had now hit the room where we were set up, and it was damn hot and sweaty in there. Our 2nd jam (after a beer and a joint) was 46 minutes long and very spaced out. The guitar players are playing very hesitantly for some reason. They can't loosen up. We created some cool grooves for sure.

We took a long break for beer and food and tried to come up with some funny names for the jams with stuff like "P.F. Poo," "I don't remember a thing," "First steps in the space Pod," etc... The next jam after the pizza was 30 minutes long but lacked energy. We are not playing like we normally do in the rehearsal room. We have been hearing the whole jams in between the different jams and the sound is amazing and it is not even mixed except very roughly. Jam #4, our last of the session did not have Michael playing as he had crashed out. It started with a very cool ambient piece and Sebastian played his best guitar for sure. Towards the end of this, Dave stopped playing bass as well and we just went into full ambient mode. In the end, 32GB of data were recorded. A hard but fun day.
