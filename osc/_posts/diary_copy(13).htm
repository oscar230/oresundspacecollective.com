    <font color="#FFFF00" face="Comic Sans MS">We arrived at the studio at 12 and
      started to load in the gear. Everyone was there except for Mognes who had to
      work until 3-4. It took a long time to get all the gear set up, mics, headphones
      for 8 people and the sound so we could just jam. It was 15:30 when we had the
      first jam. IT was quite strange to have us all jamming when people were totally
      straight (not yet high!). Despite a lot of people not hearing each other it
      was a very cool first jam piece. The sun had now hit the room where we were
      set up and it was damn hot and sweaty in there. OUr 2nd jam (after a beer and
      a joint) was 46 minutes long and very spaced out. The guitar players are playing
      very hesitently for some reason. They can't loosen up. We created some cool
      grooves for sure. </font>

    <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00">We took a long break for beer and
      food and tried to come up with some funny names for the jams with stuff like
      P.F. Poo, I don't remember a thing, First steps in the space Pod, etc... The
      next jam after the pizza was 30 minutes long but lacked energy. We are not playing
      like we normally do in the rehearsal room. We have been hearing the whole jams
      in between the different jams and the sound is amazing and it is not even mixed
      except very roughly. Jam #4, our last of the session did not have michael playing
      as he had crashed out. It started with a very cool ambient piece and sebastian
      played his best guitar for sure. Towards the end of this dave stopped playing
      bass as well and we just went into full ambient mode... In the end 32GB of data
      were recorded. A hard but fun day.</font>
