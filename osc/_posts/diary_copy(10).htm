Well, this was the one-year anniversary of our first jam. Unfortunately, Sebbe could not make it today, but we had a blast anyway. Eduardo, who joined us for jam #9, was able to make it again, which was cool. He only played on the first 2 CDs of material. It was the first time we had played in this new Bland Blanden Rehearsal room, so it was tricky finding out where to record. Results are excellent, but the guitars are too low. I promise the next jam they will be too loud for once, and the last time they will be so low. I am taking control of the loudness from now on! Enjoy the ride!!!!!!!
