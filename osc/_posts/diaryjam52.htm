  <p> Well, we are back for a 2nd year at this really cool little festival.Thanks
    Jan! It is all the same band except for 3 different guitar players, which for
    sure makes a big difference in what we will play. </p>
  <p>We left Copenhagen late as the Hertz in Sweden did not have the reservation
    and I had to hunt down and forward the emails with the confirmation and so the
    Swedes did not leave Malmo until 15, which is when they were suppose to be here!
    Anyway, we picked up PIB after loading all my gear and we hit the road. Nick,
    Thomas and Mogens would come by train and bus later. Everyone was in a great
    mood and the weather was great. We listened to the new Mars Volta (Very cool)
    and Rocket Boy by Pothead in the van. We always hear Pothead. IT is mandatory!
    The traffic was terrible so we did not get to the festival until around 18.
    Took over 2hrs for what usually takes 90 mins. </p>
  <p>The festival site looked great but there was not that many people. I really
    expected more this year but perhaps being the weekend before Roskilde Festival
    is tough no matter what. They will try to move it until the 1st weekend in August
    next year I am told. We set up our tents and got our wristbands, and beers and
    were set for our friends Fuzz Manta, the first band on. They played a great
    set. Next up was the Reggae Band, Ram Goats. All went smooth and we were only
    1hr and 30mins behind schedule. The grateful Dead tribute band The Diff wree
    up next and they like to play 2-3 hrs but lucky for us they cuttheir set short
    and stopped at like 1:00. We were suppose to start at 12:30. IT was about 1:40
    when we started playing and we got to play until 3:30 when the sound guy made
    us stop. We were really flying and playing really well and having a great time.
    We really did not want to stop. I am sure we could have played another hour
    easy. Anyway, it was all recorded and the soundboard sounds very good. One guy
    who never told me his name, drove all the way from Halle in East Germany to
    see us. I talked with him quite a bit. Very cool. We dedicated one jam to him.
  </p>
  <p>This concert was also dedicated to Dave Janey who used to play wtth us in the
    old days as he recently died. </p>
  <p>We made an audience recording but unfortunately the settings on the Edirol
    had got changed and the Lowcut was turned off and the mic was turned to Mono,
    so it is not that good but the 2 channel soundboard is excellent. We also have
    24 tracks recorded that will be mixed at a later time point. </p>
  <p>It is a very good concert... Enjoy..</p>
