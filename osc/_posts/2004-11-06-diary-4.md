# Øresund Space Jam 4, Copenhagen November 6th, 2004

![Dairy Button](IMAGES/BOTTONS/DAIRY.jpg)

We were slated to begin at 15 (3 PM). I picked up Ola and Dave from Bland Bladen at the main train station, right on time at 14:45. We went to the pharmacy so Ola could get some earplugs and off to the rehearsal room. Søren was already there. Magnus was supposed to be here at 13, but had not shown up. We started setting up a bit and then Ola and I went off to buy some beer. We got a case of Heineken and two six packs of Julehvil by accident. This is the very sweet low-alcohol kids' starter beer! Yuck!

Still no Magnus when we got back and no contact the whole day. We finally hear from him around 3:45, and he had been out drinking all night and did not get home until 11 this morning. Serious guy, eh??? He shows up at 5, and we have already started the first jam. He picks up his guitar and starts to fly during the second track. It was a strange night with lots of joints, beers, and massive amounts of synthesizers, sometimes four people playing at once! Like Mogens says, "You can never have too many synthesizers!" We played three sets of jams lasting about 3½ hours. Nearly everything is recorded, and you can hear some of the sessions now.
