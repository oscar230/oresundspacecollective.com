### Space Jam Session 24 turns into OSC meets KAABEL II  
**September 9, 2006**  
**Kaufmann's Rehearsal Room, Malmö, Sweden**

---

I took off from my place at 17:20 for the bus and then switched to another bus and finally made it to the airport. I caught the train at 18:16 and arrived in Malmö center 30 minutes later. Kaufmann was right on time to pick me up, and we headed straight to the rehearsal room. Luz, Jerry, and Tobias were already there and all set up. I had never met Luz (a Brazilian percussionist) or Jerry (from *Ruff Skunk*). Shortly after, Emil and Ola arrived with all their gear in hand.  

Kaufmann was fully set up to try multitrack recording, which took quite some time to configure, but it seems we were successful. The sound in the rehearsal room was excellent, and everyone was in a good mood. We started playing sometime around 21:00, beginning with a short warm-up jam lasting nine minutes to ensure everything was working. I recorded everything onto MD as usual, and it went perfectly.

The first jam was about 54 minutes long, after which we took a break to go outside. Inzect had arrived—we weren’t sure if he was coming or not. He and Kaufmann worked on setting up his equipment while we took a breather. It was a beautiful warm night with a full moon. Joints were smoked, beers were consumed, and after about 20 minutes, we headed back in.  

We started an ambient jam while Kaufmann went to grab some food. This jam was interesting, building up slowly while we waited for Kaufmann to return and begin playing the drums. He was just walking around, doing everything except drumming... come on, man! Finally, he kicked in, and we took off. This jam lasted a total of 53 minutes, with the first 20 or so being ambient. It had some intense moments.

Our final jam was an epic 70 minutes long. By the end, everyone had had enough. This last jam featured some real krautrock-style, intense, head-spinning moments. I felt incredibly spaced out with four synth players going at it.
