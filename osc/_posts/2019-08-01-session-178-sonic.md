### Session 178 - Sonic Rock Solstice, UK June 23rd, 2019

Cosmic Ken let these guys play ten minutes extra, cutting into **Øresund Space Collective’s** time, so I was very pissed with him. They have a strict curfew, and we traveled all the way from Denmark and Sweden, and our set was cut short. Bastard. Anyway, we just set up and did our thing, and people loved it. They were dancing, having a great time, and the lights were cool. Vince Cory joined us, and although he was nervous and didn’t step up to solo enough, he played great guitar. I was standing right next to him, and I heard every note. Great stuff, Vince.

Vemund was killing it on lead guitar, and Mogens did a lot of synth solos. Tim was a bit slow to start, but he and Jiri really got it going after a little bit. It was a pity we had to stop at 00:30—no way to play longer. Anyway, we were well received and sold nearly £1000 worth of shirts, CDs, etc. I was very impressed with the people, and the festival crew was great, taking care of the bands both on and off stage. What a great festival, and I highly recommend it. The only improvement they could make would be to offer more food options, but the food from Dragonjack’s place was excellent—they made different main dishes each day.

Great festival. More foreign people (there were very few) should give this festival a chance.
