Everyone was in a very good mood when we met up between 16:00 and 17:00 to pack up the gear and head over to Malmö. The night before, Ola, Johnny (Transubstans), and I spent 3½ hours putting all 950 of the 1,000 double CDs and their artwork into the clear DVD cases. Phew! Hard work, but it turned out amazing. The sound and the look of the CD are just fantastic. It’s such a cool professional package. Everyone was proud of the CD.  

Around 17:00, we headed off to Malmö. There had been very heavy winds, but it calmed down, and the bridge, which had been closed for a short while, was open. We had no hassles and went straight to the unknown venue. It had a cool stage but was a little small for us, and Ola had to set up on the floor. After many hours, the sound was set up, the screen with the amazing projections by Emil and Jonas, the DJ equipment by Erik, and everything else. We were all set!  

We had some nice food, some lousy beer (*Slotts* — awful stuff), joints, and relaxed while we waited. The merch table was set up. A few of our Danish friends, Lene (aka Faxy), Tom, Peter, and a lot of Swedish friends, Johnny, Göran, Miranda, Petter, and others, showed up. In the end, only about 30 people came.  

### Set 1: 57 minutes  
We started playing around 23:15. The first set was amazing. I was completely blown away by the music, grooves, and intensity. Everything was just so good. Even though no one was dancing, only the people who knew us were watching, and the rest were in the smoking room.  

And then there was this crazy dog that was running around, tripping out on my black light-painted robe and trying to bite the small sleeves. This dog would mess up our recording later!

### Set 2: 79 minutes  
We lost 20 minutes of this set when the dog jumped up and pulled the minijack out of the MD recorder.

- **Long Road to Seattle 2 - Stoned Mode Parts 2** - 34:50

Erik was a great DJ, playing super cool music from Colour Haze, Ole Lukkoye, Shpongle, Ozrics, Hidira Spacefolk, Baby Woodrose — just amazing stuff!

For the 2nd set, Jocke played bass, and Michael sat out (he played his ass off in the first set!). By the time we started the 2nd set, it was 1:45. I was really feeling tired, and the sound in this concrete place was harsh on the ears, even though the venue looked so nice with projections and cool blacklight banners by Jonas. Unfortunately, the crowd wasn’t really into it, and the sound was quite poor on stage, especially for the 3rd set.  

It was after 3 in the morning when we started the 3rd set. Again, Jocke played bass, Kaufmann played drums, and Luz joined on percussion at the very end. I was too tired to enjoy this, but it seemed very spaced out. Mogens played some cool stuff, but I couldn’t hear anything Ola played, and the stage sound was awful. The volume of the keyboards in the monitors was turned down, and others turned up.  

Sebastian really poured his heart out in his playing that night, and I love his new space echo.

### Overall Thoughts  
Visually, it was the best show we’ve had, but it wasn't one of our best concerts musically. The crowd was small, and the sound was a disaster by the 3rd set. Still, we had our moments. It was a tough crowd, but we managed to sell four CDs. Vivian, the organizer, bless her soul, is such a wonderful person, but even with only one week of promotion, she couldn’t get enough people through the door.
