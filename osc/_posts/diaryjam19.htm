# Space Jam 19  
**Carpet Knights Space Lounge, Malmö, Sweden - February 10, 2006**

### Event Summary  

Wow! Jam 19... and the first time we jammed in Malmö since last May. It was great to have Kaufmann back drumming and to play with Tobias, Jonas (Kaabel), and Göran (Drahk van Trip).  

This was an experimental night as we recorded the entire session onto 8-track using a Fostex hard disk recorder. I arrived at 17:15 at the Mantric Muse rehearsal room, and after a quick stop at Netto for beer, we were off to Sweden. The car was crowded, with Michael balancing his bass head on his lap in the front seat. But it’s a short trip, and we cruised through customs without incident, heading straight to the Folket's Hus without getting lost.  

The setup took hours. We didn’t start playing until 21 due to the intricate arrangement of cables, microphones, and mixers. Kaufmann had 11 microphones on his drum kit, mixed down to 2 channels. The guitars went into another mixer but were sadly mixed together. Synths by Jonas (Novation Nova II), Ola (Nord Modular + laptop soft synths), and myself (Nord Lead 2) were also mixed into 2 channels. The bass and Kasper's conga/djembe each had separate channels. The multitrack recording sounds fantastic and will be available to share.  

As always, balancing guitar levels was a challenge. Magnus was too low in the first jam, while Tobias was just right. Then Tobias turned down, Magnus turned up, and the balance flipped. It was loud but exhilarating. Michael's bass lines were cool, Magnus experimented with trippy sounds, and Ola played synths reminiscent of Magnus's glissando guitar. Kaufmann’s drumming, especially on *Kaufmann’s Space*, was phenomenal.  

Despite some issues with my mini-disc recorder missing a few pieces (including a 12-minute jam with Göran), the session was a blast. Everyone played well, and the vibe was incredible.
