# Øresund Space Collective Jam 20  
**Black Tornado Studios, Copenhagen - March 10-11, 2006**

---

### Event Summary  

This was our second studio session, and everyone was incredibly excited about it. As always, we experimented with a different setup. The weekend was a whirlwind of creativity, challenges, and some of the most amazing grooves we’ve captured.  

#### Day 1:  
The session began at 4 PM with preparation. By 6 PM, Lars was setting up mics, with a simplified arrangement of 4 microphones on the drums. The gear setup resembled a concert, with drums in the middle, guitars on either side, and synth players at the back. A Mantric Muse PA was used to simulate a live setting without requiring headphones for everyone.  

**Highlights**:  
- The first jams were a mix of experimentation and intensity, with a 51-minute initial recording that included heavy riffing and wild synths.  
- After a break for food, joints, and drinks, the second set kicked off, lasting over two hours and producing hypnotic Krautrock grooves with stellar synth dynamics and fiery guitars.  
- A stunning 41-minute jam followed, concluding Day 1 with a spaced-out, heavy finale.

By the end of the day, we had recorded over 75 minutes of top-notch material.

#### Day 2:  
The group reconvened at 1:30 PM, feeling refreshed and ready to push the creative envelope further. After some fun with a didgeridoo and a warm-up blues jam, the recordings resumed.  

**Challenges and Achievements**:  
- Some technical issues delayed the session, notably with the grand piano mic not connecting to the new channels.  
- Despite the setbacks, we captured some of our coolest jams, including a heavy piece with stellar lead synth solos and intense guitar work. Unfortunately, a ProTools crash resulted in the loss of over 10 minutes of incredible material.  

The session concluded with two final jams, including a mind-blowing, heavy, and hypnotic groove led by Michael’s incredible bass lines.

### Reflections  

In total, we recorded **6 hours and 13 minutes** of material over the two days. This session was one of the most incredible weekends we've ever experienced, filled with laughter, camaraderie, and a shared dedication to capturing the most mind-blowing grooves possible.
