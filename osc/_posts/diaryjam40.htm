        Feb 22, 2008</font>
    </strong></p>
  <p>The band line up on this night was: Mogens, Dr. Space, Sebastian, Stefan, Thomas,
    Luz Kaufmann, Johan. On the 3rd set, PIB played drums and P&auml;r from Sgt.
    Sunshine played the bass. </p>
  <p>14:30 I picked up Seb (Flowershowers) at his place in &Oslash;sterbro and then
    we came back to my place to get my stuff. The Swedes were suppose come show
    up at 15:15 and we would go to Christiania. They called at 15 and were just
    leaing Malmo so we went straight to the venue as Seb needs as much time as he
    can get to setup. </p>
  <p>15:20 Mogens arrives with his gear.</p>
  <p>15:40 The Swedes arrive and I help to lead themthru the driving maze to the
    back of the club and we load in the gear. The people at the club are very cool
    and helpful. The sound guy in particular. </p>
  <p>16:15 Stefan and Thomas arrive with their gear and we get it all loaded in.
    Magnus also arrives around this time as well. </p>
  <p>17:05 We are getting close to doing a full soundcheck. Luz is the last one
    to get his stuff set up. </p>
  <p>18:40 We finished the soundcheck. I recorded most of it and took a few photos.
    It went pretty well. Sound is great on the stage. A lot of beer drinking and
    joint smoking going on and the mood is great. The projections are going to be
    awesome. 3 projectors and 3 screens. A friend of Luz's has a really nice video
    camera and will film from the DJ booth. </p>

  <p>19:30 We are getting some nice food. A vegitarian lasagna, salad and bread
    with avacado dip of sorts. Very nice. People are hungry and quite stoned. We
    will all go for a walk and some fresh air in Christiania after. </p>
  <p>20:15 I just got back from a short walk with Johan, Thomas and Stefan and Michael
    (singer in Stefan's band SumoSun). They are hanging out in Nemoland. The weather
    is very windy and feels like a storm is in the air but it is mostly clear and
    you can see the full moon! Cold... People are hanging out in the backstage and
    rolling joints for later and in a really good mood. Ola is there as well. They
    will all go for a walk soon and I will set up the merchandise stand before the
    doors open at 21. </p>

    Backstage with Friends</p>
  <p>23:30 Wow.. what a great 1st set. Quite a lot of people now. Over 100 and the
    visuals are amazing. Everyone was really happy with the stage sound. Hope the
    front sound was good as well. Sebastian and Stefan played really great melodic
    guitars and were really complimenting each other well. The last jam of this
    set was a mindblower... Set was about 70 mins.</p>
  <p>Set I: Entering into Space 5:45, Interference 33:38, Band Intros 1:31, Circular
    Compartment 15:20, Pain Relief 16:23</p>
  <p>12:00 We are about to start the 2nd set with Johan from <a href="http://www.fbfos.com">First
      band from Outer Space</a> replacing Seb. </p>
  <p>1:15 Wow.. another great set and Stefan and Johan traded some killer lead guitar.
    Thomas and Kaufmann were grooving as well. This set was a little shorter. 63mins?
    The place really seemed filled up ok now and some girls were dancing. So great
    to see a lot of our friends, Jesper, Kai and Susan, John and Johnna, Torben
    and his friends, the people from Kildemose Festival, Stojs and Palle, Petter,
    Tom and Julie, Ola and Stine, Nils and Anders and more, as well as a lot of
    new faces... People I had not seen at our other shows. Tobias and Jocke and
    others had come from the Mars Volta show durng the beginning of the 2nd set.</p>
  <p>Set II: Loppen Jam 23:48, He knows you did it 7:45, Flowershowers 35:22</p>
  <p>2:30 We just finished the 3rd set. Par from Sgt. Sunshine (a little drunk)
    played the bass and PIB (lots of energy) took over th drums. THis was a very
    uptempo set with half the band playing high energy and half the band played
    a bit stoned and sleepy. I was really tired and not adding much to the soundscape.
    About half the people had left by the time we started at 1:35. </p>
  <p>Set III: PIBs in the Chair 21:21, Bass Traps 17:42, Hold your Tongue 13:39</p>
  <p>4:00 Home... it was an amazing night. I look foward to hearing the audio and
    seeing the video. We did 22 track recording from the soundboard but something
    appeared to be wrong and it was never tried to figure it out so it does not
    look promising at this time. I hope I am wrong. I could not look after this,
    the merchandise, my own audience recording, getting the band on stage, etc...
    it is just too much. Magnus did all the work with the Hard disc recorder and
    I am really grateful. </p>
