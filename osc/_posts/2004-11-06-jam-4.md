# Øresund Space Collective Jam Session #4  
**Copenhagen, November 6th, 2004**

We were slated to begin at 15:00 (3 PM). I picked up Ola and Dave from Bland Bladen at the main train station, right on time at 14:45. We went to the pharmacy so Ola could get some earplugs, and then headed off to the rehearsal room. Søren was already there. Magnus was supposed to be there by 13:00 but hadn’t shown up yet.

### Setting Up

We started setting up a bit, and then Ola and I went off to buy some beer. We got a case of Heineken and two six-packs of Julehvil by accident. This is the very sweet, low-alcohol kids’ starter beer. Yuck!

Still no sign of Magnus when we got back, and no contact from him the whole day. Finally, we heard from him around 3:45 PM. He had been out drinking all night and didn’t get home until 11 AM. Serious guy, eh? He showed up at 5:00 PM, and we had already started the first jam. Magnus picked up his guitar and started to fly during the second track.

### The Session

It was a strange night filled with lots of joints, beers, and massive amounts of synthesizers—sometimes four people playing at once! As Mogens says: *“You can never have too many synthesizers!”*

We played three sets of jams lasting about 3½ hours in total. Nearly everything was recorded, and you can hear some of the sessions now.

Enjoy the music!
