### Øresund Space Collective - Session 21 in the MM Space Place  
**Saturday, April 8th, 2006**

Tobias and Kaufmann arrived at my place around 2:30 in the afternoon after Kaufmann had picked up a new Sonor Jazz set from the 80s. We hung out for a while and listened to the new On Trial and Baby Woodrose CDs, some Kingston Wall, and some OSC. I made some spaghetti and then we took off for the MM Space Place about 4:30. Kasper, Magnus, and Michael were there ready for us. Kaufmann did not want to play on Søren's drums and Mogens had not shown up yet (and he never did!), so it took a bit for the drums to be set up just right, etc. We had a beer and some joints, as usual. Heard some of the last jam in Malmö (#19). Magnus had the Big Muff and a Small Stone pedal in his arsenal today, and it sounded great. Tobias had also just gotten a new guitar and was excited to play it. It is a 1974 Telecaster in very good condition. Beautiful guitar.

#### 18:00  
We just had the soundcheck jam and Tobias needed to turn up, but other than that, it sounded really good. Kasper was not set up yet, though, so after 15 minutes, he was ready and happy, and we could have our first real jam. Wow! We played some heavy grooves during the end of the first jam. Cool. Kaufmann was playing some swinging and heavy stuff as well. Great sound and vibe.

#### MD1: 51 minutes  
There was a great vibe in this first jam and quite a heavy groove built up. Great dynamics between Tobias and Magnus. Still no Mogens. Strange he does not call? Anyway, the break was short, and another joint was floated.

---

#### MD2: 54 minutes  
Wow! I thought we had some intense stuff in the first jam, but damn, this was some heavy material, perhaps the heaviest we have ever played at times. Not a long time before we got going again.

#### MD3: 45 minutes  
This jam starts with Magnus on synths, Kaufmann, Tobias, and Kasper on congas. I played only very briefly at the beginning and then sat down. After a very cool guitar riff was started, Michael jumped up and began playing the bass again. A great groove was laid down now. The synths Magnus played can hardly be heard, though. Ok, it did not really develop that much. Kasper and I sat a lot of this one out, with plenty of crazy guitar madness going on. Kaufmann is really a monster, keeping everything upbeat, with no breaks to slow down much. Some pretty cool stuff in this third jam.

---

#### MD4: 51 minutes  
Again, this starts with Magnus playing the Oscar ("Gettin' Loopy") with Tobias on guitar, Kasper on bass, and Kaufmann on drums. Michael and I mostly sat it out. Klaus W showed up with a huge bud of skunk, and a joint was produced. Everyone was very high already. This jam is all over the place, but there is a cool piece in the middle of this one. Mostly, though, it's noodling in all directions.

In the end, it was a great session of music and quite intense at times.
