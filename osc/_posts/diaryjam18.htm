# Øresund Space Collective CD Release Party  
**Dragens Hule, Copenhagen - January 21, 2006**  
**Session 18**

### Event Summary  

This was our CD release party, and we had just received our CDs and t-shirts—it was going to be a fantastic night despite the -5°C weather outside. We were the only band for the evening, and I was hoping for a good turnout. Thankfully, people showed up in great numbers!  

We started at 22:10 and played the first set for about an hour. The energy was great, and the crowd kept growing as the place slowly filled up. I sold a few CDs and t-shirts, and the vibe was incredible.  

The second set began around 23:30, with about 65 people in attendance. We truly hit our stride during this set and played some of our best pieces. Friends from Sweden, Denmark, and beyond—including Tobias and Dorte, Kaufmann, Inzect, Erik, Petter, and the Gas Giant crew—were there to support us. Johnny brought Suzanne and Göran from Drahk von Trip.  

For the third set, Jocke joined us on bass, and it was amazing to have him back. With a finely tuned PA system, the sound was phenomenal. The entire band was soaring, and the energy stayed high throughout the night. We finished earlier than usual, and while I was exhausted, it was an unforgettable experience.
