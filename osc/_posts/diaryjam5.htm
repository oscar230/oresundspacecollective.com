# Øresund Space Jam  
**Malmö, Sweden, Saturday December 4th, 2004**

Well, I picked up Søren and then Magnus, and we went to pick up the gear and Michael before heading off to Malmö. It costs 460kr for a roundtrip across the bridge or 170kr each for the train, so it’s worth it. The downside is that one of us (me) has to stay sober to drive.

### Arrival and Setup

We arrived at the rehearsal room around 17:30, and Kaufmann was already there. Anders and I went to pick up the Novation (Nova II) along with some extra mics and cables from Tobias and Jocke from the Carpet Knights. By the time we got back, most of the gear was set up.  

Eduardo from Sgt. Sunshine was supposed to join us for the jam but blew us off completely. Tobias was also supposed to join but was under pressure as Record Heaven was releasing his band, the Carpet Knights’ CD, in January, and he needed to finish it first.

### Adjustments and Challenges  

As we were going to have fewer players, I called Sebbe, and luckily, he could join for a while. That was great! We planned to mic all the instruments except the drums and try to take an output from the mixer to the MD (MiniDisc) to see if we could get a better recording.  

I spent nearly an hour running back and forth into the hall trying to get the setup right while the others warmed up. In the end, we never managed to get the synths to record properly.  

Some of the jams were captured through the mixer using Core sound mics to pick up the drums and synths in the room, but it didn’t come out quite as we hoped. Regardless, we recorded about 100 minutes of music in total, and you can hear some of it.  

Enjoy!
