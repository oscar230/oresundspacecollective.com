# Øresund Space Jam, Paradisbygget, Finnerödja, Sweden Nov 11-12th, 2005

This was a hell of a weekend. Not everything went perfect but we did play some damn cool music. The adventure began on Friday when I picked up the trailer and headed out to the Mantric Muse rehearsal room. I arrived soon after 11. Søren was asleep, having worked the whole night and had only been sleeping from 9 this morning. We were totally loaded up to head to Malmö by 12:05 after a stop to buy 3 cases of beer and a bottle of whiskey. We were quite stunned to find out that the bridge cost 970DKK with a trailer for the round trip. That is like $150! We arrived at the old Bland Bladen rehearsal room around 1:15. Emil and Ola were late, not arriving until about 1:45 with the van. We quickly loaded all the gear from the car and trailer and into the van and then we had to go pick up Dave and go to his apartment to get the PA. Well, no one could find the place where Dave worked and we drove around for like 45 minutes including several phone calls to Dave. Insane.... We finally got Dave, but now we were more than an hour later than planned. We now had 4 cases of beer (24 cans, 2 cases were 0.5L cans), 2 bottles of whiskey, and plenty to smoke. We finally hit the road for Finnerödja at 15:45. Anyway, the joint rolling and beer drinking was to start as Ola drove us for the next 5 hours out into the middle of nowhere in Sweden.
