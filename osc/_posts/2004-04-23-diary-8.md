# Øresund Space Jam, Dragens Hule, København Feb 25th, 2005

This was the debut gig of the Øresund Space Collective. Everyone was in good spirits even though some of the members were not feeling very well. We played with two other bands on this night, Dream Jockey and Tender Prey. Both were a totally different kind of music but both quite good. The crowd was clearly mostly here to see us (I think some thought they were going to see Mantric Muse!). It was a very late night. We did not get to start playing before 1:30 in the morning, and we played until nearly 5! We took a couple of small breaks but pretty much kept the space music flowing and the people still wanted more at 5 in the morning. The response was amazing from the people. The lineup of two guitars, two bassists, drums, conga-djembe, percussion, and two synthesizers worked amazingly well. All of the stuff was recorded and sounds quite good. We really were on a great journey this night and played stuff like we have not played since some of the early jam sessions.

The music is broken down into 13 pieces of music. Some or all of this show will be available.
