										<p>The Øresund Space Collective was formed in April 2004. The collective is a
											group of Danish, Swedish and American musicians that get together as often
											as possible for free form improvised space rock music. The flavour of the
											music is different with each session. The jams can often combine complex
											interplay between guitar and synthesizer as well intense drumming and bass
											playing. We enter into the genre of funk, jazz, reggae and space and stoner
											rock as we improvise our way along. The jam sessions alternate between Malmö
											and København across the Øresund bridge! The core of the collective features
											current and former members of the Danish bands Mantric Muse and Gas Giant as
											well as the Swedish bands Bland Bladen, Derango, and the Carpet Knights.
											Occasionally other musicians join as well from other Swedish and Danish
											bands like the Sgt Sunshine, Siena Root, Drahk von Trip, Sumo Sun, The
											Univerzals, and Kaabel. Recently, has also been joined by Sula Bassana from
											Germany and most recently Claus Bøhling from Secret Oyster and Hurdy Gurdy
											fame. In 2018. Martin Weaver (Dark, Wicked Lady) has begun to play with the
											band in Portugal.</p>
										<p>The collective records all of the jam sessions and makes these available to
											fans via the web site in MP3 format. We currently have over 40 hours of
											material on the web site for free download. The bands debut CD was released
											on the Transubstans label (www.recoredheaven.net) from Malmö, Sweden in
											January 2006. IT was a limited edition of 500 numbered copies for the first
											pressing. The band has also released a series of 12 CD-Rs called Picks from
											Space which feature the best of the jam sessions 1-27. In March 2006, the
											band completed its latest studio session. This was released in October 2006
											as a double CD in a deluxe DVD case and called &#8220;It&#8217;s all about
											Delay&#8221;. The bands 3rd CD, The Black Tomato, was released in a deluxe
											digpack format in 1000 copies in August 2007. The bands 4th CD was released
											on Sept 26th, 2008 on the Sulatron Label and it is called Inside your Head.
											Good planets are hard to Find, out 5th CD is came out in Feb. 2009 on
											Transubstans. The Dead Man in Space vinyl LP was released in 300 copies on
											the Kommun2/Pariah Child labels. The CD Slip into the Vortex came out in
											June 2010 on Transubstans. The deal with Dead man in Space to be released in
											Japan fell through so we released this on our own Space Rock Productions in
											April 2011. Our performance from the Roadburn Festival in 2010 was released
											on a double vinyl only release in May 2011. The bands first release with
											Claus Bøhling from Secret Oyster, Hurdy Gurdy, Elektrum fame was called
											Entering into the Space Country in July 2011 as a vinyl and digital download
											release only on the Kommun2 record label. In November 2011 we released the
											Sleeping with the Sunworm digpack CD in 500 numbered copies. THis was
											recorded at the same sessions as Slip into the Vortex and features one
											56mins jam. In May 2012, the companion on Entering into the Space Company
											called Phaze your Fears was released on vinyl on our own Space Rock
											Productions label. It was recorded the same day in the studio and same line
											up as Entering into the Space Country. Summer 2012 saw the release of the
											West, Space and Love record. This was a chilled out album of just guitar,
											sitar, hand drums and synths recorded at the Space Station Studios CPH and
											featured Love and KG from Siena Root and Dr. Space. There was a limited
											edition pressing with around 120 hand painted covers and 80 others with only
											a printed sheet. All were hand numbered. A second press of 500 was made as
											well. In Oct 2012 the band toured the Balkan countries and released the Give
											your Brain a rest from the Matrix CD in a digipack format in 500 copies.
											THis was a new studio session with a lot of sitar from KG, pedal steel from
											Mattias (My brother the Wind) and guitar by Claus Bøhling as well as the
											normal OSC cast.. Jan 2013 saw the release of our long sold out debut album
											from 2006 on a double vinyl in only 300 copies. This sold out in a week. In
											May we released the Entering into the Space Country and Phaze your Fears in
											a double CD with new artwork. In May, we played two concerts in Hamburg and
											gave away free a CD of multitrack mixes from our Oct 2012 tour. In June, a
											split 7&#8243; with the Danish band Papir was released on the Transubstans
											label in Sweden. In July, a double vinyl record from the Kildemose Festival
											was released. This is a local festival, we have played every year since
											2008. Nov 2013 saw the release of our new studio album featuring American
											guitarist Daniel Lars called Organic earthly Flotation. THis was released on
											vinyl in 500 copies. In 2014 we will release a triple live record with Damo
											Suzuki, Its all about delay (our 2nd release from 2006) in a 4LP box set and
											a new double studio LP/CD. 2015 saw the release of the double LP/CD, Music
											for Pogonologists. In 2016 we released the Differenct Creatures 3LP set as
											well as a triple CD live from our 10 year anniversary concert at Loppen. In
											May 2016, the Ode to a Black Hole LP/CD was released, the bands 21st
											release. A European tour was made in support of the LP. At the end of 2016,
											a new double LP was released called Visions of as well as a double LP from
											our concert in Trondheim, Norway in 2007. 2017 saw the release of a split LP
											with Maat Lander and a new studio album called Hallucinations inside the
											Oracle, featuring amazing Ed Unitsky artwork. May 2018 will see the band
											head off to play gigs in Denmark, Holland, Germany, Austria and Belgium in
											support of the Chatoyant Breath 2LP /CD release which features Gary Arce
											from Yawning Man. 2018 and 2019 were extremely active with several studio
											albums (Kybalion, Freakout in the Fjord), two live albums- Live in Berlin
											and Live in Tampere. 2020 will see another studio album and limited edition
											live CD-rs..</p>

											Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Germamy, Holland, Switzerland and Belgium.</p>
