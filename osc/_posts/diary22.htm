# Session 22, Dragens Hule, København 7/21/06  
**(with [First Band From Outer Space](http://fbfos.com))**

The band on this night: Dr. Space, Sebastian, Michael, Jocke, Ola, Søren, Kasper, Mogens, and Magnus.

What can I say? It was a great night despite a lot of small problems and the heat in the club! I met up with Magnus at 16:00, and we went to his workplace to loan some equipment for the gig. We came back, set the stuff up, and brought his guitar, the bass rig, and Søren's drums down to the Dragens Hule. We had a lot of trouble with the projector and in the end never managed to have the cool psychedelic images due to the lack of a laptop computer to use and interface. Carl, from FBFOS, was supposed to bring a 3-hour DVD with cool space images but forgot it...

At 18:00, the bus arrived with Michael, Søren, Ola, Emil, and Sebastian. The guys in FBFOS arrived 10 minutes later. It took a while for things to get into motion. People were pretty laid back having beers and joints, hanging outside where it wasn’t so hot. We got the gear set up, but small problems with the monitors, etc., delayed us. In the end, when people started showing up around 21:00 (when we had said we’d start), we weren’t ready. It was 22:00 by the time we began, and there was a really great crowd by this time. People from my work, Chris and Camilla from Switzerland, Tom, Nils, Jens, Stojs, Johnny, Goran, Susanne, Lasse, Emil, Carsten M, and many others brought friends. It was so nice.

### First Set

Our first set was only 50 minutes. I think we should have played one more track, but it was hot, and First Band needed to set up—they got no soundcheck at all. We stopped after 5 jams, including our shortest ever, around 1 minute! Sound was pretty good. People liked it.

### FBFOS Set

It took 1 hour to get FBFOS ready to fly out into space, but once they did, it was a blast. It was fun to play along to songs again and reminded me of the good times in Gas Giant. Would love to space out with those guys again... Anyway, their set was 7 songs, 75 minutes long, with a lot of jamming, including a cover of *The Right Stuff* by Bob Calvert (Hawkwind).

### Second Set

Only 30 minutes after FBFOS finished, we were ready for our second set. This one was 70 minutes long, and we played some incredible grooves with Jocke on the bass.

It was a great party—people were happy, drinking lots of beers, and smoking plenty of joints. At 4 in the morning, there was still a good crowd of people.

### Final Free Form Jam

There was one more free-form monster jam with Göran from Drahk Von Trip on drums, Thomas from Gas Giant on bass, Magnus on guitar, Frippe (bass/synth player from FBFOS) on Moog Rogue, myself only some of the time, Mogens for some of it, and Emil on djembe (FBFOS). It started very spaced out and built up into a heavy piece, quite strange. It lasted only 25 minutes, and that was it. Unfortunately, my battery died, so I missed the spacey part and only have the heavy stuff for 15 minutes recorded.

### Notes on Recording

The whole show was recorded, and Magnus, Michael, and I listened to it afterward. While there are some very cool pieces of music, there are serious problems with the recording—mainly, you can barely hear the guitars most of the time, and Ola and the percussion are almost inaudible. The sound is dominated by the bass, drums, Mogens' amazing keyboard playing, and my space sound effects, which are often too loud. It’s really unfortunate. Tracks on MD1 suffer from feedback from the conga microphones, messing up the sound badly. I plan to re-equalize the raw files and try to improve the mix. Still, it’s disappointing. We really need a proper soundcheck next time.
