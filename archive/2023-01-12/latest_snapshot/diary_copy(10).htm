<p><font color="#99FF00" size="3" face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this was the one 
  year anniversary of our first jam. Unfortunately, Sebbe could not make it today 
  but we had a blast anyway. Eduardo,who 
  joined us for jam #9, was able to make it again, which was cool. He only played 
  on the first 2 CDs of material. It was the first time we had played in this 
  new Bland Blanden Rehearsal room so it was tricky finding out where to record. 
  Results are excellent but the guitars are too low. I promise the next jam they 
  will be too loud for once and the last time they will be so low. I am taking 
  control of the loudness from now on! Enjoy the ride!!!!!!!!</font></p>
