<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00">We were slated to begin at 15 (3Pm). 
  I picked up Ola and Dave from Bland Bladen at the main trainstation, right on 
  time at 14:45. We went to the pharmacy so Ola could get some earplugs and off 
  to the rehearsal room. S&oslash;ren was already there. Magnus was suppose to 
  be here at 13 but had not shown up. We started setting up a bit and then Ola 
  and I went off to by some beer. We got a case of Heineken and two six packs 
  of Julehvil but accident. This is the very sweet low alcohol kids starter beer! 
  Yuck! </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00"> Still no Magnus when we got back 
  and no contact the whole day. We finally hear from him around 3:45 and he had 
  been out drinking all night and did not get home until 11 this morning. Serious 
  guy, eh??? He shows up at 5 and we have already started the first jam. He picks 
  up his guitar and starts to fly during the second track. It was a strange night 
  with lots of joints and beers and massive amounts of synthesiers, sometimes 
  4 people playing at once! Like Mogens says, &quot;You can never have too many 
  synthesizers!&quot;. We play 3 sets of jams lasting about 3&frac12; hrs. Nearly 
  everything is recorded and you can hear some of the sessions now. </font></p>
