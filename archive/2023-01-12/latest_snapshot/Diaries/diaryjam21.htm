<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">&Oslash;resund Space Collective- Session 
  21 in the MM Space Place. Saturday April 8th, 2006</font></b></p>
<p>Tobias and Kaufmann arrived at my place around 2:30 in the afternoon after 
  Kaufmann had picked up a new Sonor Jazz set from the 80s. We hung out for a 
  while and listened to the new On Trial and Baby Woodrose CDs, some kingston 
  Wall and some OSC. I made some spaghetti and then we took off for the MM Space 
  Place about 4:30. Kasper, Magnus, and Michael were there ready for us. Kaufmann 
  did not want to play on S&oslash;rens drums and Mogens had not shown up yet 
  (and he never did!), so it took a bit for the drums to be set up just right, 
  etc.. so we had a beer and some joints, as usual. Heard some of the last jam 
  in Malmo (#19). Magnus had the big muff and a small stone pedal in his arsenal 
  today and it sounded great. Tobias he also just got a new guitar and was excited 
  to play it. It is a 1974 Telecaster in very good condition. Beautiful guitar. 
</p>
<p>18:00 We just had the soundcheck jam and Tobias needed to trun up but other 
  than that is sounded really good. Kasper was not set up yet though so after 
  15 minutes, he was set up and happy and we could have our first real jam... 
  Wow....we played some heavy grooves during the end of the first jam. Cool. Kaufmann 
  is playing some swinging and heavy stuff as well. Great sound and vibe...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MD1 51 minutes.</p>
<p>There was a great vibe in this first jam and quite a heavy groove built up. 
  Great dynamics between tobias and magnus. Still no Mogens.. Strange he does 
  not call?? Anyway, the break was short and another joint is floated....</p>
<p>MD2 54 minutes</p>
<p>Wow... I thought we had some intense stuff in the first jam but damn this was 
  some heavy stuff, perhaps the heaviest we ever played at times. Not a long time 
  before we geting going again.</p>
<p>MD3 45 min</p>
<p>This jam starts with Magnus on Synths , Kaufmann, Tobias and Kasper on Congas. 
  I play only very shortly at the beginning and sit down. After a very cool guitar 
  riff is started Michael jumps up and starts playing the bass again. A great 
  groove is layed down now. The synths magnus plays you can hardly hear though...ok...it 
  does not really develop that much. Kasper and I sit a lot of this one out with 
  a lot of crazy guitar madness going on... Kaufmann is really a monster... keeping 
  everything up beat, no breaks to slow down much. Some pretty cool stuff in this 
  3rd jam...</p>
<p>MD4 51min</p>
<p>Again, this starts with Magnus playing the Oscar (Gettin' Loopy) with Tobias 
  on guitar and kasper on bass and kaufmann. Michael and I mostly sit it out.. 
  Klaus W showed up with a huge bud of skunk and a joint was produced.. Everyone 
  was very high already.. This stuff is all over the place but there is a cool 
  piece in the middle of this jam but it is mostly noodling... in all directions..</p>
<p>In the end, a great session of music and quite intense at times...</p>
