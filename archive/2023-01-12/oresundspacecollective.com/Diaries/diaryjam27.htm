<p>16:05 Henrik, Sebastian and I arrive at the Studio. Magnus had just SMS'd and 
  they would be there with the gear from the gig the night before in 25 min. </p>
<p>16:30 They arrive and because Andy has the key, we are able to get in and start 
  putting all the gear up and in the studio. People are in a great mood but a 
  bit tired. We had already put all our gear up to the studio door on the 2nd 
  floor. After we moved all the stuff in we wait until S&oslash;ren gets his drums 
  set up and then we set up the rest of the gear. See some of the video clips 
  later when you can see how the process went. We enjoy a beer and a joint and 
  the mood is very good. We come up with some good names for jams, but I won't 
  tell you them now. </p>
<p>17:50 Lars is in a great mood and is working closley with Henrik Udd as they 
  choose which microphones to use on the different instruments. We use this massive 
  very expensive Blue Bottle microphone on the kick drum as well as a EV RE20. 
  IT is all telefunken tube microphones on the guitars. This studio has a world 
  class selection of microphones to use. Helps to get our amazing sound. The room 
  is slowly coming together. I went around and made a list of all the gear we 
  are using for the session this time:</p>

<p>18:27 Mogens is pretty far along with setting up all his keyboards and the 
  Mackie Mixer, Michael makes the next joint. Seems the mics on the drums are 
  fine now. I hope we can play some music around 21! </p>
<p>19:08 Starting the line check for the drums. Still no Swedes yet! Everyone 
  is doing great. </p>
<p>19:45 Swedes arrive and quickly set up and are doing great. </p>
<p>20:06 We ordered some pizzas and stuff and we have had two power blackouts 
  in the recording room. Lars hunts it down to the new air conditioner that he 
  has installed. Sure enough this was the problem. NO more black outs...</p>
<p>20:52 We have just had a food break and everyone is having a great time and 
  waiting to play! Need to check the keyboard lines, get the synths into the PA 
  and do a headphone check and we are ready to roll! I guess 1 more hour. Another 
  joint is smoked and the first case of beer is almost gone now. </p>
<p>21:10 We are still working on the synth channels. </p>
<p>21:30 We are having a serious problem with the unit that syncs between all 
  the channel inputs from the board and the computer to get the extra channels 
  we need, Up to 28 or 29 channels now. </p>
<p>21:54 Still having problems. People are relaxed and quite tired but playing 
  it cool. Smoke another joint and some people have some coffee now. Sebastian 
  is asleep and Tobias is testing his gear. Control room is very warm but now 
  we open the window (4-5C outside). Still problems but now he has exchanged it 
  out to see if that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>22:37 Problem Solved! Back on track. My channels are all fine and the headphone 
  sound is amazing! Ola is testing now.</p>
<p>23:18 More delays. Magnus and mogens spend 30 mins or more and have to give 
  up trying to sync a delay unitl to the OScar. When will we start?? People are 
  feeling really ready to play but when???</p>
<p>00:02 NOw we have to change the power supply to the PA, Shit... Ola is also 
  having major headphone problems and the headphone control unit has to be switched 
  out. </p>
<p>00:30 We finally are staring to jam. </p>
<p>1:20 We just had a pretty cool 45 min jam. The beginning was all just fucking 
  around though but the end we had some monster grooves. This is some of the heaviest 
  most stoned stuff we have done in some ways. People are not that stoned, I don't 
  think. Maybe I am wrong? Henrik said the sound was great in the control room 
  and all is functioning fine. I recorded a bit with the Edirol. We hear some 
  of the jam and then decide we will jam some more!</p>
<p>1:50 People smoke another joint and are feeling really fine now. Mogens rolls 
  his first clear joint. Not as easy as it looks... Ok.. Off we go..</p>
<p>2:35 Wow... we just had a totally amazing jam. 42:30 was recorded on the computer. 
  Jocke played the bass on this jam. Holy Space War rock. It started with Lars 
  on the drums and then later he did a very cool Hammond solo. Mogens almost did 
  not play. Can't hear himself and too tiredd to be inspired. Problems with the 
  headphones as well on the left side. The Hammond that ate Tobias.. possible 
  title that comes up in our jokes.. I love it with all three of the guitar players.. 
  Some Tribal Monster Ethno Trance was played. Very cool stuff. Ola was amazing..</p>
<p>3:35 Wow.. a new jam begins with Lars on the bass. Lars is the owner of the 
  studio and with a few beers and a some puffs, he was really into what we were 
  doing and wanted to be part of it... Anyway, Ola, Seb, S&oslash;ren to start 
  with and then Magnus and Mogens join in. I also play a bit as well at the end. 
  Michael takes over the bass after Lars drops it and plays the drums after S&oslash;ren 
  stops. This last part of the jam was cool as I recall but not sure about the 
  rest of it.. Perhaps 40min more recorded. </p>
<p>4:30 We go to sleep. Henrik, Seb, Jocke, and Tobias come to my place and Ola 
  stays at Magnus's. See you tomorrow..</p>
<p><font color="#00FF00" size="4"><strong>Day 2</strong></font></p>
<p>10:55 I have been up for a bit now... some thoughts on the day. It seems like 
  every session we have one guy has a bad time. First session it was Sebastian, 
  last session it was Ola that had problems, now Mogen's is really having a bad 
  time. Who will be next... Yesterday, we played some of our heaviest stuff ever 
  and very tranced out. Wow.. Tobias was amazing on guitar and when he wouold 
  lay down a killer solo, it just laid the lanuching pad for Magnus, who would 
  explode into space as well. Mind blowing.. Can't wait to hear the rough mixes. 
  I did not record that much from the recording room on the Edirol but today it 
  is free for 3hrs of recording and I will record more. We shot about 30 mins 
  of video of the setting up of the equipment, people sitting around, the control 
  room, etc... should be fun. We should try to shoot some while we play before 
  it gets dark. </p>
<p>14:55 Everyone showered and then Seb, Henrik and myself ate some chicken and 
  potatoes, while Jocke and Tobias went for a burger. We had some coffee and bread 
  this morning but needed something big before 10 more hours in the studio. People 
  are feeling good but tired. They drank a lot more beers than I did as I have 
  to drive the car at the end of the night! We go to the store and pick up bread, 
  cheese, smoked trout, juice and milk and head back to the studio and Magnus's 
  place where everyone else is waiting with coffee. We hang out for a bit and 
  at 15:25 Lars is here to talk about the day and drink some coffee. He is in 
  a great mood and they will work on fixing Mogen's problems straight away.. </p>
<p>15:42 A round of beers goes out and Michael makes the first joints to get everyone 
  in the mood. Mogen's problems are tricky as he does not like the headphones 
  but the others can't handle the synths louder in the PA so what to do. Magnus 
  is trying to help out as well so we can get this solved and start playing. They 
  change the headphone controller, different headphones, new levels, etc... </p>
<p>16:15 Still not right for mogens, and more beers and joints. When will we fly 
  again???</p>
<p>19:41 We just finished a long 62:47 jam session. Mogens is struggling and gave 
  up again. We played some very moody stuff and also a long heavy groove. People 
  liked it and all is fine except poor mogens is not doing well. He is tired, 
  frustrated and this is a bummer. I miss his playing but luckly, Ola is filling 
  the gap quite ok and playing a lot of cool Rhodes piano, which helps as Mogens 
  has generally filled this role in the band. Anyway, more joints and beers and 
  we hear some of the stuff. Wow..it sounds so fucking good. Lars and henrik are 
  smiling in the control room, as they are enjoying it and doing a great job on 
  the sound as well. </p>
<p>18:07 S&oslash;ren, Michael, and Ola are starting to jam. The first jam has 
  jocke, tobias, magnus, ola, scott and S&oslash;ren, and mogens for a small while. 
</p>
<p>18:49 That was a mind blowing trance jam... WOW:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::... 
  People are really happy with that jam, Pink Floydish to start then tranced out. 
  We hear some of it and is sounds killer.. THis will be on the new CD for sure. 
  Lars just got some food but people are not ready yet. More pizza tonight again?? 
  Some more possible titles come up for some jams like Sweet Space Caroline, Space 
  Chick Viking Cleaner, NOt enough Space chicks around... Can you tell there are 
  a lot of single men in the band?? Only 2 our of 9 guys have girlfriends...... 
  space rockers are just not that attractive.. our brains are somewhere else....</p>
<p>20:10 We just had a long jam (50 min)with only Magnus on guitar for most of 
  it. Mogens is finally in and really playing well. Magnus laid down a killer 
  E-bow solo that blew me away. Seb came and played for like 15mins. We had smoked 
  some Budda's sister in the peace pipe before this jam. This was very inspiring 
  for sure. People are really in a different happy mood at the moment. </p>
<p>20:30 We are ordering some food now and taking a long hr break or so. More 
  beers and joints are passed around. Sound on the rough mixes is really great. 
  Wow.. This is such an amazing fucking studio. There is Trouble in my Space Neighborhood. 
  I have to say we played some super cool stuff in the jam we are listening to 
  now. Not sure which one it is...</p>
<p>22:00 Magnus brings a bottle of Line Aquavit and more beers and joints. We 
  had to buy another case of 30 beers as we bought 3 cases and drank them all. 
</p>
<p>22:52 Seb and I have dropped out of this jam but it is still going on Ola is 
  playing guitar (first Magnus's then Sebs), Jocke on Bass, Magnus played some 
  synths and Hammond before putting on his guitar, Mogens is on the Fender Rhodes 
  piano. Finally Tobias decides to join in and this kicks it up a level and a 
  heavy jam is staring. I run back into add some space!!!</p>
<p>I come out again and Tobias is now on the drums with just ola, jocke and mogens... 
  Everyone else is too tired. This was very experimental and most of it not that 
  good. People are just having fun now. I am totally exhausted. </p>
<p>23:05 Tired of playing music. I think I will put up some of the Ediorol recordings 
  for people to hear...My feet are very sore. My overall feeling is pretty good. 
  I don't think we had the same kind of peaks and Mogens was out of the picture 
  for almost the whole first day and the start of today but we created a new sound 
  as well with Tobias and just me and ola on synths. Sebastian, he gave it all 
  on thursday and drank too much and had too little to give at the studio session. 
  I don't think he ever really took off on his playing, which was sad as he is 
  an amazing young guitarist and I am so proud he plays with us! Tobias was the 
  star, the one that pushed us somehow.. Great...I played pretty well but Ola 
  was stellar! We never got so tranced out before. Thanks.. and of course the 
  bass players were top notch and S&oslash;ren, last but not least, fucking brilliant... 
  No other words. </p>
<p>We got a total of 6&frac12; hrs recorded (85GB of data). I guess about 1&frac12; 
  hrs is just the tape running and not much is happening but still a lot to chose 
  from!</p>
<p>00:11 All the gear is packed out of the studio and people are enjoying the 
  last beer before Lars closes the place up. We have to clean up the place as 
  another band comes tomorrow. A big party is going on downstairs so we are about 
  to go down there for the 2&frac12;hrs it will take to transfer the data from 
  Studio hard disc to the two we have, one for us and one for Henrik Udd, who 
  will mix the pieces that we choose. </p>
<p>03:30 Finally home in bed... another great OSC session ends...</p>
<p>As you can see we have a lot of music to sort through...</p>
