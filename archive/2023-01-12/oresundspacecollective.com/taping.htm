Audience taping is permitted at all &Oslash;resund Space Collective (OSC) shows. 
When OSC is performing at a festival or other event featuring multiple bands, 
that particular event's policy may override OSC's customary taping policy. Sound 
Board patches may not be made available at all shows. A soundboard patch is available 
at the discretion of OSC's sound engineer. Please ask politely. Plan on providing 
your own power. Come prepared. We can't lend you extension cords, blank tapes, 
adapters, etc <br>
<br>
The enjoyment of the audience in attendance at a concert always takes precedence 
over recording efforts. This means that at no time should tapers ever require 
other patrons to be quiet or otherwise interfere with their enjoyment of the show. 
<br>
<br>
<b>DUPLICATION</b><br>
All participants in audio recording exchange (regardless of format) acknowledge 
and respect the copyrights and exclusive ownership of the music and performances 
by the performers, writers and publishers. All taping must be for personal use 
only, which may include trading (via analog or digital tape, CD, or digital file 
transfer). Recordings may be traded only for an equivalent amount of similar media 
(cassettes or CDs, pre-recorded or blank). Regardless of any expenses incurred, 
no money may ever be exchanged as part of a trade; however, stamped, self-addressed 
envelopes may be included with blank media. <br>
