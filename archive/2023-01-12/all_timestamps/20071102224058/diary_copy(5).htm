<p><font color="#FFFF00">Well, I picked up Søren and then Magnus and then we went 
  to pick up the gear and Michael and off to Malmö. It costs 460kr to take the 
  bridge roundtrip or 170kr each for the train, so it is worth it. It just means 
  one of us (me) has to stay sober to drive. We arrive at the rehearsal room around 
  17:30 and Kaufmann is there. Anders and I go pick up the Novation (Nova II) 
  and some extra mics and cables from Tobias and Jocke from the Carpet Knights 
  and get back and they are mostly set up now. Eduardo, from Sgt. Sunshine was 
  suppose to jam with us but blew us off completely. Tobias was also suppose to 
  join but is under pressure as Record Heaven will release his band, the Carpet 
  Knights CD, in January and they have to finish it first! </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">As we were going to have fewer players, I called Sabana 
  up and he coudl make it for a while, so that was great. We had talked about 
  putting mics on all the instruments except the drums and try to take an output 
  from the mixer to the MD to see if we could get a better recording. I was running 
  back and forth out into the hall for the best of an hour while these guys warmed 
  up trying to get it right. In the end, we never did get it so that we could 
  hear the synths on the recordings. There is a few jams recorded through the 
  mixer using the Core sound mics to pick up the drums and synths in the room, 
  but we never got it right. Anyway, we recorded about 100 minutes of stuff in 
  the end and you can hear some of it! Enjoy........ </font></p>
