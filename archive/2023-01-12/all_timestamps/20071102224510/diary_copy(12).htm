<p><font color="#66FF00">Well, despite so many things going wrong, we actually 
  pulled off a pretty good gig. We wanted to play longer but there was another 
  band still to play after us (Dream Jockey) and we did not get to start until 
  nearly 2 in the morning as it took us 1hr and 10 minutes to get the gear all 
  set up and some technical problems as well. This was the first gig with what 
  I think of as the full line up of the OSC (our last gig did not include Ola). 
  Our jam sessions have really been fun and we seem to really be coming together 
  now. If we were to actually tour and be on the road playing 15 gigs in 20 days, 
  the music would just be insane by the end. Anyway, in the end, despite all these 
  hassles, it was a great jam session we had, with some amazing music and a great 
  sound on the recording. Enjoy, we did.</font></p>
