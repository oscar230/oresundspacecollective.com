<p><strong><font size="4">Session 33- Mantric Muse Rehearsal Space Place, K&oslash;benhavn 
  May 3rd, 2007</font></strong></p>
<p>Mantric Muse were rehearsing until 22:00 so I arrived just at 22 and PIB and 
  all the MM guys were sitting around smoking cigs and having a beer. Everyone 
  was in a good spirit and MM had just rehearsed for 3 hrs. Mogens was down in 
  Dragens Hule but would be up in a few minutes. I set up my Octave Cat (no Nord 
  Lead today!) and was ready. PIB brought all his own drums except the kick drum, 
  he used s&oslash;rens. IT is always interesting to play with some one new but 
  PIB was quite psyched. While he was setting up I showed the others the draft 
  of the digipack artwork for our next CD, The Black Tomato. People thought it 
  was cool. Still needs some work but it is getting there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, we started at about 22:45 and had 3 long jams for about 66 minutes. 
  Everyone had a really good feeling about it, which was good. PIB is a good drummer, 
  quite jazzy, more like Kaufmann than S&oslash;ren in my opinion. S&oslash;ren 
  also played some accents and fills on the other drum kit in the room. Sound 
  on the recording is very good except that there is some static a few times during 
  the first 20 minutes or so. NO idea where that comes from as the recorder was 
  sitting in the same place with no movement of recorder or mics... Mogens new 
  NOrd Modular G2 keyboard sounds great. I am really getting into the CAT these 
  days as well. Magnus and Michael play very cool stuff. A good short session. 
  Enjoy...</p>
