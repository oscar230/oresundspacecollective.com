<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3">Dr. Space, Mogens, Michael, S&oslash;ren, Magnus 
  and Sebastian. Only 6 of us..</font></p>
<p>It was a hard day but amazing as well. Started at 16 when we packed all the 
  gear up (Magnus, me and Mogens). Sebastian was sitting in his car when I arrived 
  at 16 and that was great. He had a 6hr drive to get here. Andy, the van driver 
  was 30 mins late but we packed up the stuff and were at Studenterhuset at 17:30. 
  Michael, S&oslash;ren, sonja and the Siena Root people were already there. Everyone 
  was waiting for us. We set up all our gear said hello. Sonja worked hard to 
  get the lights and projector up and running and we set up for soundcheck. We 
  could barely fit on the stage but it was cool. Took until after 19 then we took 
  nearly all the gear away and Siena Root set up. I set up the merchandise table 
  with the 2 extra guys who were traveling with the band. One, Stian, played Sitar 
  with them. Anyway, a lot of our friends were showing up to help with recording 
  and just to support us. After Siena Root finished at 20:30, we all went to an 
  all you can eat Turkish buffet resteraunt and had a nice meal together. These 
  are our true friends. Such kind people and very gifted players. Anyway, back 
  to the club at 21:15 and they hit the stage at 21:35 and played a killer one 
  hour set. Wow.. the crowd loved them as well. THen it was our turn to put all 
  the gear up once again! I think we started about 23:15 or so and we played all 
  the way until 1:00, when we had to stop. We had the cool projections again and 
  some white and blue lights by Sonja. We played some heavy stuff as well and 
  took really long trips. People were flying and loved it. Great to see them all 
  getting into our trip. The people are out there.. Spread the word..</p>
