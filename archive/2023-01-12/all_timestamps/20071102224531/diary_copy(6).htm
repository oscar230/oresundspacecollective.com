<p><font color="#FFFF00">I picked up S&ouml;lvi, Sabana, and Dave from the main 
  train station about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. We went straight to the grocery 
  store to buy beer and we got lots! A case of half liter Carlsberg, two six packs 
  of 38cl tuborg classic and some more. When we arrived they were all setting 
  up and it looked like I would be the only synth player as Mogens could not make 
  it. It was Dave's birthday so he and S&ouml;lvi, were all dressed up in suits 
  and ties and looked quite strange compared to the rest of us space rockers. 
  A big joint was smoked and we were off. The first jam was about and hour and 
  had 3 guitars (Magnus, Sabana and Solvi) and Dave on bass. Michael had not yet 
  arrived. The sound in the rehearsal room was excellent and I found a great place 
  for the microphones. The last part of the jam was not useable as Solvi decided 
  to play some drums and he was not good. Cool guitarist...but stay away from 
  the drums...</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">We decided to go and get some pizzas and this was a good 
  idea to get everyones energy level back up. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">After a beer and joint break, we were back and this jam 
  was almost 80 minutes long and went through some amazing transitions. I was 
  totally blown away by the stuff that Magnus and Sabana were playing and the interaction 
  between us all had never been this good. Michael and Dave are both playing bass 
  on a lot of this jam.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Jam #3 started with S&ouml;lvi playing some really cool 
  bass lines and Kroglund played some synths with me and magnus on drums. Later, 
  Solvi and Dave were playing guitars with Magnus and Sabana and they were playing 
  something in one direction and magnus and Sabana in the other. IT sounded really 
  strange but ended up quite cool. YOu can hear this one as Acid Soup. THis jam 
  was 71 minutes.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">There was a 4th jam but people were pretty stoned and 
  feeling the beers now as well so this was quite strange and ended after 25 minutes........ 
  Overall, this was our best session ever. Everyone was pretty pleased with the 
  material we created. I have started to play with compression and reverb on the 
  recordings to try to better optimize the sound. </font></p>
