<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">We had not played together since July and everyone 
  was in a really great mood and very hungry to play today. Sebastian now lives 
  500km away near &Ouml;rebro in Sweden, so it is always great when he can make 
  it for the jam sessions. I picked up Ola, Sebastian and their friend, Emil, 
  who was armed with a Roland SH-101, to assist me in making spaced out sounds.. 
  It was a little over 19 when we arrived and we said hello but got the gear set 
  up pretty much straight away then, the joints and snaps were had and we had 
  our first jam. SOund was very loud today. S&oslash;ren had moved his drums into 
  the corner (further from where we put the microphones) and also one of the PA 
  speakers. SOund was great today... 4 synth players, this was a first.. We even 
  had five at one point when Magnus played as well. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">The first jam was 48 minutes and had someof the 
  heaviest stuff we had ever played. Wow... some aggresive playing and Sebastian 
  played some hot guitar right from the start. Magnus would catch his fire soon 
  though as well. Us synth players, we were in space all the way... A lot of interesting 
  dynamics were explored.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">A snaps, beer and joint break and we came back and 
  jammed for 65 minutes. This was totally far out and Magnus played some killer 
  heavy metal like riffs as flew long past the nebula into another universe. Sebastian 
  broke a string and the jam sort of ended... Flying out there....</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">A short 27 minute semi- ambient piece where Michael 
  took a break on the bass and Mogens played some bass. This was actally a very 
  very cool jam.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">We really wanted to play and we did! The next jam 
  was like 42 minutes and started off quite strange and the whole thing was a 
  strange mixture of electronics, folk guitar, jazz guitar and lots of far out 
  sounds. Some sort of free jazz electronic experiment... strange but very cool....
