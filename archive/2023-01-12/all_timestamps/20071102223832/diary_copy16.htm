<div align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">This was a hell of a weekend. NOt everything 
  went perfect but we did play some damn cool music. The adventure began on Friday 
  when I picked up the trailer and headed out to the Mantric</font><font color="#FFFFFF">Muse 
  rehearsal room. I arrived soon after 11. S&oslash;ren was asleep having worked 
  the whole night and had only been sleeping from 9 this morning. We were totally 
  loaded up to head to Malm&ouml; by </font><font color="#FFFFFF">12:05 after 
  a stop to by 3 cases of beer and a bottle of whiskey. We were quite stunned 
  to find out that the bridge cost 970DKK with a trailer for the round trip. That 
  is like $150! We arrived</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> at the old Bland Bladen 
  rehearsal room around 1:15. Emil and Ola were late, not arrriving until about 
  1:45 with the van. We quickly loaded all the gear from the car and trailer and 
  into the van and</font><font color="#FFFFFF">then we had to go pick up Dave 
  and go to his apartment and get the PA. Well, no one could find the place where 
  Dave worked and we drove around for like 45 minutes including several phone 
  calls to Dave. Insane.... We finally got dave but now we were more than an hour 
  later than planned. We now had 4 cases of beer (24 cans, 2 cases were 0.5L cans), 
  2 bottles of whiskey, and plenty to smoke. We finally hit the road for Finner&ouml;dja 
  at 15:45. Anyway, the joint rolling and beer drinking was to start as Ola drove 
  us for the next 5 hours out into the middle of nowhere in Sweden. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">
