  Audience taping is permitted at all &Oslash;resund Space Collective (OSC) shows. 
  When OSC is performing at a festival or other event featuring multiple bands, 
  that particular event's policy may override OSC's customary taping policy. Sound 
  Board patches may not be made available at all shows. A soundboard patch is 
  available at the discretion of OSC's sound engineer. Please ask politely. Plan 
  on providing your own power. Come prepared. We can't lend you extension cords, 
  blank tapes, adapters, etc <br>
  <br>
  The enjoyment of the audience in attendance at a concert always takes precedence 
  over recording efforts. This means that at no time should tapers ever require 
  other patrons to be quiet or otherwise interfere with their enjoyment of the 
  show. <br>
  <br>
  <b><font color="#FF0033">DUPLICATION</font></b><br>
  All participants in audio recording exchange (regardless of format) acknowledge 
  and respect the copyrights and exclusive ownership of the music and performances 
  by the performers, writers and publishers. All taping must be for personal use 
  only, which may include trading (via analog or digital tape, CD, or digital 
  file transfer). Recordings may be traded only for an equivalent amount of similar 
  media (cassettes or CDs, pre-recorded or blank). Regardless of any expenses 
  incurred, no money may ever be exchanged as part of a trade; however, stamped, 
  self-addressed envelopes may be included with blank media. <br>
