<p align="center"><strong><font size="4">Session 50, Dragens Hule, K&oslash;benhavn 
  April 9th, 2009</font></strong></p>
<p>The players on this night: Nick- Guitar, Magnus- Guitar, Mogens- Synths, Dr. 
  Space- Synths, Kasper congas, PIB- Drums, Michale- Bass</p>
<p>18:30 I arrive at the rehearsal room complex and take my gear up to the Mantric 
  Muse rehearsal room. Janis is there. He goes ouot for a walk and I am just hanging 
  out and hearing the Hyvink&auml;&auml; concert on the PA while I wait for the 
  others to arrive. Michael should be here soon and Mogens, Nick and Magnus will 
  be here around 20 and we will figure out what to do. I met the guys in Highway 
  Child and had a chat with them. They have been jamming and drinking all day 
  and were quite happy. They gave me a copy of their CD to review. They will also 
  play at Kildemose this year! Cool. Really nice people. </p>
<p>19:20 Met with PIB and he is doing fine and excited to play some more space 
  rock. The weather is beautiful as I sit in the window here and have a beer with 
  the music cranked up. Magnus's new marshall set up looks awesome.. See the pic 
  in the diary. </p>
<p>19:50 Michael is here. He is in a good mood. It has been since last October 
  that he has played bass with a band. Magnus has just come in as well. </p>
<p>21:20 We are mostly set up now. I only have the Octave Cat and the Kaossilator 
  Pad today since I have to bring all my gear in the christiania bike. A couple 
  of Nick's friends are here (Lasse and his wife). Janis and Sonja are also here 
  and there. A few others will pop in over the night for sure. Seems that one 
  of the speakers in Michael's bass cabinet was blown out at the last OSC gig 
  in October and we will have to pay to replace this speaker. He is playing direct 
  into the PA. SOunds good. </p>
<p>22:35 After many many joints, we finally did have a jam and it was pretty amazing 
  stuff but damn loud. Mogens is still having a lot of trouble with his sound. 
  I think magnus will be too loud and Nick a little too low in the mix but let's 
  see. Some very cool stuff for sure. The jam was just about 59 minutes. </p>
<p>00:15 We had another about an horu loing jam and this was also awesome. NIck 
  shot right out and played this killer guitar solo (see sessions page) but is 
  sadly too low but you can hear it. Wow. Lots of cool stuff. Nick is leaving 
  but I think we will have one more jam after some more beers and joints. </p>
<p>02:30 People were really stoned in this last jam but I really liked some of 
  what we played. Space out to the max! My ears are wasted though. It has been 
  a loud night and now I have to pack all my stuff and ride back home. Phew..... 
</p>
