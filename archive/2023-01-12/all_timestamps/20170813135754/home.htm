<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hope that you are all having a great summer. 
  Sorry for the silence but I have moved countires and it took nearly 2 months 
  for the shipping container to arrive. We are happy to announce that the next 
  &Oslash;Sc album will be called Hallucinations inside the Oracle. It was mixed 
  by Jonathan Segel with spiritual guidance from Hasse. The amazing artwork is 
  by Ed unitsky! Preview soon. This starts production now and we except it to 
  be out in September. It will be a double LP gatefold with 4 inserts. A single 
  CD. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to everyone who came out to the last

  nice to see friends from Austria (Hubert, etc.), Finland (Artsi, Santtu, Jaire, 
  Vesa, Eetu), Sweden (too many to thank you all!), Germany, Norway.. Wow.. I 
  was honored. Show is great as well. </p>

  Feb 15th (<a href="https://archive.org/details/OSC2017-02-15.FLAC">check the 
  recording out!</a>). </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The Split LP witih Maat Lander is due at the

  </strong>Happy new Year.. Lots of new &Oslash;SC music planned for 2017. We 
  just had another studio session with the members for the Univerzals, Nicklas 
  from Papir and Gary from Yawning Man. Mixing is in progress. We decided to do 
  one last minute show for our friends in Sweden on Friday Feb 10th at Plan B 
  in Malm&ouml;. A space cosmonaut party. We will be on at 22. Here is a teaser 
  video for the split LP with Maat Lander that will be out in April. Might be 
  a split LP with Yawning Man out in May.. Keep you posted...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">As you may have heard, there will be a break 
  from live shows in 2017 as Dr Space is leaving Denmark. We will play a goodbye 
  show, Dr Space leaves this Place at Loppen on Sat. March 18th, 2017. The two 
  most important Danish bands in my life were On Trial and Gas Giant. I have convinced 
  them to please get back and play for me and they agreed. Thanks Henrik and Stefan..

  Daniel Lars, who came over from the USA to play with &Oslash;SC in the studio 
  in 2012 and who mixed and produced and wrote the song Walking on Clouds (the 
  A side) that we had an amazing jam on. Sadly, we have discoved that inside the 
  album in says David and not Daniel on guitar. This is a great mistake and I 
  am very sorry that this was not detected before printing. Sorry Daniel.. You 
  did an amazing job on the record and it sounds fantastic and your music will 
  live forever in the OSC format. Peace.</p>

  Indra but the 35 people who were there got a great 3hr trip with great visuals 
  by Anders and his mates. I am working the recordings etc.. now.. Since less

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello Everyone,</p>
<p align="center">Thank you all for making 2012 the best year ever for &Oslash;SC. 
  We played more concerts this year in more different and cool places than ever 
  before. We visited Sweden, Germany, Austria, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Croatia. 
  What a great trip we had in October. We are working slowly on a tour DVD thanks 
  to all those who filmed and recorded us. The concerts were really great this 
  year with a lot of different musicians and several new ones as well playing. 
  We had many live highlights but reuniting in Dragens Hule on December 1st with 
  the first &Oslash;SC line up that recorded the first few records and played 
  all the live shows and jam sessions was great! Pity it was not videotaped this 
  one. </p>
<p align="center">We also released three records this year: West Space and Love, 
  Phaze your Fears and Give your brain a rest from the Matrix. Thanks to you all, 
  we have had really done well with the sales and while none are sold out, we 
  sell them steady and this brings enough money back into the band for a future 
  studio session and more records. </p>
<p align="center">For 2013, we will release our Debut CD on a double vinyl with 
  some extra material as well. It is due in early November in an edition of 300 
  copies on blue and black vinyl. The blue vinyl ones are all sold now. Next up 
  will be the double CD release of Entering into the Space Country (2011 on Kommun2, 
  sold out) and Phaze your Fears. These two vinyl only releases were recorded 
  on the same day in the studio and fit nicely together. There is no extra material 
  from that day in the studio so the CDs are the same as the vinyl records but 
  have been mastered by Henrik Udd for CD. This will come out in March or April. 
  In the summer we will release the first of two vinyl records (maybe 1 CD) from 
  the studio session in April 2012. This material is being mixed by Daniel Lars 
  and 6 tracks are now finished. We must decide what order, how to put it together, 
  etc.. This features the members from the Danish band Papir. We still hope to 
  release Live at Kildmose Vol 1 and 2 with an Italian label but I am not sure. 
  The tracks have been mastered for vinyl and are ready to go. Finally, if we 
  are lucky we will release our 2nd CD, It&#8217;s all about delay in a 4 LP box 
  set with Sound Effect records in Greece. This is a very expensive adventure 
  so we have to see if we can both afford to do it and if the price can be kept 
  down to make it affordable for the fans. Finally, the split 7&#8221; with Papir 
  should also come out. Phew..</p>
<p align="center">So what else will we do. Right now, we do not have so many invitations 
  to play live so 2013 might be a bit more quiet. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Our last show of the year is this Saturday 
  at Dragens Hule with Mantric Muse, who will release their first full length 
  CD. Hope to see a lot of friends and fans. The test pressing of our debut LP 
  sounds amazing and has been approved so the double LP will be out in mid-January. 
  Also, the Entering into the Space Country and Phaze your Fears are being mastered 
  for CD now and will be released as a double CD in Feb next year. That is the 
  plan.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">It is election day in the USA.... Won't make 
  a big difference as they are pretty similar these two.. Anyway, our debut record 
  has been sent out to production for vinyl. It will be released in 300 copies 
  on vinyl (100 aquamarine blue, 200 black). It is a joint release with Sound 
  Effect Records in Greece. I will put out a pre-order once I have the test pressing 
  and approve this. These are likely to sell out quite quick. Feel free todrop 
  me a mail if you want to reserve one. Only one coloured vinyl per person. Sorry... 
  I am also working on some of the multitrack recordings from the tour. I think 
  we played some killer shows after hearing most of them now. Enjoy...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THE COMPANY THAT 
  MADE OUR LAST CD MADE CD-Rs AND NOT GLASS MASTER CDS. I AM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT 
  THIS (as I only chose this company because they were in Denmark and about the 
  same price as I could pay in Germany for a real glass master CD, so I was deceived!) 
  AND FEEL REALLY BAD FOR ALL OF YOU THAT HAVE SUPPORTED US AND PAID 16&euro; 
  FOR THIS CD. I HAVE NOW LOWERED THE PRICE AND IF YOU HAVE ORDERED IT, PLEASE 
  SEND ME EMAIL AND YOU WILL GET SOME GREE DOWNLOAD CODES FOR BANDCAMP AS COMPENSATION. 
  I AM VERY UPSET AND SORRY ABOUT THIS AS WE WOULD NEVER MAKE A CD-R OF A RECORD 
  WE SPENT MONTHS MIXING AND WORKING HARD ON THE ARTWORK, ETC... </p>

  Thanks to Cvetan, Horst, Vltako, Erich and Graf Hugo (where we played our best 
  show), the Go Bananas guys (Hubert and Wolfmaster!), Fjodor and all at Medika

  to work through the audio... Patience.. Hope you are all enjoying the new CD... 
  We also have some long sleeve tour shirts left over. Black and white logo on

  listen! The test pressing for West, Space and Love arrives next week and the 
  hand painting of the records is really moving forward. Almost half done now. 
  Thanks to Alexandria (Jakobstad, Finland) for helping out a lot this weekend.

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Finally... it has been a long wait but the 
  West, Space and Love sessions are coming together. This is 5 tracks of mainly 
  acoustic guitar, sitar, hand drums and synths that was recorded in Dr. Space's 
  home studio in Oct 2009. The current plan is that the first vinyl press of this 
  is only going to be 100 copies with hand painted covers. These will be pretty 
  expensive but we are putting a lot of love and time into these. I hope we can 
  have them out in April. IT will take some time to hand paint 100 covers. Send 
  <a href="mailto:oresundspacecollective@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> to reserve a copy! 
  Feb 9-11th, I we will be mastering the Phaze your Fears LP tracks and also the

  The first concert dates for the year are starting to come in. We are working 
  hard of getting the next studio material finsihed. We have one LP and one CD 
  that need song titles, artwork and to be mastered for release. We are also working 
  on a double DVD live from Loppen 2011, which we have excellent multitrack mixes 
  and 4 camera angles. No idea when this will be finished but I hope by the summer. 
  Thanks to everyone who is buying the lastest CD. I am really happy with the 
  results. A new single out take from the IT's all abotu Delay sessions is coming 
  out on Jan 21st on <a href="http://www.prog-sphere.com" target="_blank">Progsphere

  are some new reviews out there now as well that you can get from the link on 
  the left. We are on a new server now as well so downloads of the music mught 
  be even faster! We are working on a CPH concert with Papir and Causa Sui in

  Nick from Progsphere. Sleeping with the Sunworm has been sent off for production 
  as well and you can pre-order it now in the shop. That is the good news. The 
  bad news is that Danish post prices are killing us and I will no longer be able 
  to mail CDs with the plastic case. I will probably have to raise a few of the 
  prices. I am really sorry about this. They make way more money on our music 
  than we do, bastards... $10 to mail one CD, that is just insane... The cheapest 
  without the case is 33kr or about $6 if it is under 100gms. Crazy prices. Anyway, 
  we have a new CD out soon...</p>

  Thanks to Brandon for filming the concert. Dragens Hule may open again in November

  Street Journal</a> for all the thorough reviews and nice interview in his Aug-Sept 
  issues. There are two other new interviews up as well on our site and out there. 
  Sleeping with the Sunworm artwork is finished and I am just looking for a place 
  to have the digipacks produced so I hope it will be out in late October! We 
  play this saturday at Loppen in Christiania with the Univerzals! NO other shows 
  are planned this year since the trip to India was cancelled for this year. Maybe 
  next year.. We will see.. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Sleeping with the Sunworm in CD form is going 
  to be delayed even further. The artist who was doing the artwork has disappeared 
  sadly and the income from our vinyl releases is quite slow in returning so the 
  planned digipack will come out later this year. In the meantime, if you must 
  hear the new CD, you can buy the digital files at <a href="http://oresundspacecollective.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> 
  but also soon all places worldwide. I have just to sort out the barcode. We 
  will find out in the next week or so if we will play in India. The organizers 
  must search for a new venue. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">IT was nice to see a lot of friends at our 
  concert at KB18 on the 18th. The recording is up on the net now. Seems the response 
  to the new record is very posititve. I am really happy that everyone likes it 
  so much. Steve Hayes is currently mixing material from the 3rd day in the studio 
  from that same session and it is sounding very good. We do not have any more 
  planned gigs at this time unless we go to India. We will spend the time working 
  on the multitrack recordings from Occultrance and Kildemose and mixing the 3 
  other records we have in theworks. Once we sell enough Roadburn and Entering 
  into the Space Country LPs, we will release the Sleeping with the SUnworm digipack. 
  A new web page is in the works as well. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hope everyone is having a nice summer. Thanks 
  to all those who have been buying the Dead man in Space CD, some downloads at 
  bandcamp, and the Live at Roadburn LPs. Entering into the space Country is due 
  to arrive on LP next week. There will soon be several new interviews on line. 
  I will post the links when I have them. Check the interview link on the left 
  side of our main page. See some of you in Holland and Belgium. Here is a <a href="http://www.unimeri.com/PsychotropicZone/reviews.en.php?subaction=showfull&id=1310718877&archive=&start_from=&ucat=3&" target="_blank">link</a> 
  to three excellent and detailed reviews of our latest 3 releases. Enjoy.. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">June 18th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The Double live at Roadburn record is out now 
  and available from <a href="http://www.sulatron.com" target="_blank">Sulatron</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.kozmik-artifactz.com" target="_blank">Kozmik Arifactz</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.burningworldrecords.com%20%20" target="_blank">Burning World 
  Records</a>, and <a href="http://www.recordheaven.net" target="_blank">Record 
  Heaven</a>. IF you really want to buy it from us, this is also possible but 
  our Danish postage prices are really insane. It costs almost 20&euro; just for 
  the postage to send the double vinyl record to the USA. It is 11&euro; for Europe 
  for the postage plus the cost. I just approved the test pressing for Entering 
  into the Space Country, which will be out in 4 weeks on Kommun2 records. Our 
  10th release. I have also added links the the right of this page for Soundawesome 
  and Bandcamp, where you can also buy our products and MP3-FLAC downloads! Inside 
  your Head will soon be available in a digital format for the first time ever. 
</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">May 23rd</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to those who came out to the Dead Man 
  in SPace release party (about 50?) and bought the CD (10). We played a epic 
  5 hr concert! Wow... some totally amazing stuff. Wait until you hear it! The 
  link is <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2011-05-21.FLAC&reCache=1" target="_blank">here</a>! 
  The double live at Roadburn Record arrives this week.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">OSC is going to India! We will play two concerts 
  in India on Sept 23-24th, 2011. It is not 100% yet but looking very promising. 
  The artwork and mastering for &quot;Entering into the Space Country&quot; is 
  done and this will be sent to press in the next two weeks. See some of you at 
  our show tomoorrow night. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">May 9th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We have just finished the mastering of a future 
  release for Kommun2 records that will probably be called &quot;Entering into 
  the Space Country&quot;. Vinyl only release at least for now. We also have made 
  a cool arrangement with a new radio and art program called<a href="www.aiiradio.net" target="_blank"> 
  There and Back</a>. Check it out... Live at Roadburn double vinyl records are 
  due to ship on May 24th to Denmark.. Coming soon....</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">April 30th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">All the concerts are up now so enjoy the great 
  music we made over Easter. You can read the diary and see the pictures as well. 
  YOU can tell we had a blast. It is so nice to make new exciting music for us 
  and the people. Once we create it, it belongs to you, the people, the fans... 
  Hope you are enjoying our new CD as well.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">April 26th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to everyone who helped out on our tour 
  of Sweden and Finland. Financially it was a disaster but musically it was some 
  of the best this collective has ever played and I think you will all be totally 
  blow away when you listen to the recordings. Sadly, none of the places had a 
  suitable mixer for making multitrack recordings so only audience recordings 
  are available. The Dead man in Space CD is out now and hope you enjoy it. Thanks. 
  The diary and the pics are up and the Stockholm show you can hear now. . </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">All the best</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">April 18th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The Dead man in Space CD is here and will be 
  mailed out tomorrow to all those who pre-ordered it. Thanks. It was great to 
  see so many OSC fans at <a href="http://www.roadburn.com" target="_blank">Roadburn</a> and I 
  had a blast playing with Dragontears. Hope we get a chance to play again one 
  day. Speaking of Roadburn, the OSC- Live at Roadburn double vinyl is due to 
  arrive on May 16th. More info on where you can get it will follow. Hope to see 
  many of our fans at the gig in Sweden and Finland later this week! </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">April 2nd</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I hope you all have been enjoiying our great 
  last concert in Odense. The Dead man in Space CD will finally go into production 
  next week after a royal nightmare with the artwork and in the end it is still 
  not exactly the way I planned and wanted it but it can just not wait any longer. 
  NOt sure we will have them before Sweden and Finland. Sorry. The Live at Roadburn 
  double vinyl is in production and test pressings will be sent in a week or so. 
  Earliest delivery date is now May 2nd. Anyway, I will see some of you at Roadburn 
  in 2 weeks time! For those going to Occultrance, we play on the saturday at 
  midnight until we want to stop!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">March 18th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I managed to find the time last night to make 
  a mix of the multirack recording from Odense. Enjoy... <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2011-03-12.multitrack&reCache=1" target="_blank">Here.</a>. 
  How many other bands provide a professional mul&aelig;titrack recording to the 
  fans for free?? Thanks for buying our music as well. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">March 15th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">A special thanks to Jan D and all the Kildemose 
  people who helped out and volunteered their time to make our gigs in Fyn really 
  fun. Thanks to Jonas and Rasmus from Causa Sui for playing excellent music. 
  The Odense gig was multitrack recorded and smoking! Nicklas from Papir joined 
  us on the last jam. You can see the pics, read the diary and hear the concerts 
  now on the sessions frame. Enjoy. We sure had a great time. Tobias and Jonas 
  played amazing guitar...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">March 7th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The Dead man in Space CD prodcution is having 
  artwork difficulties so will be delayed a few weeks now. Damn.. We hope to sort 
  these out this week. Promos will be sent out at the end of the month. We still 
  need a concert in Finland on Sat April 23rd, if anyone can help?? My friend 
  <a href="http://tinytapes.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Robert Lawson</a>, has just broken 200 
  CD-R releases this last week, so congratulations to you Robert! </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Feb 20th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Dead man in Space CD master sounds amazing 
  and will be sent off to production this week. We hope to have them in time for 
  our Danish tour dates in March. Sleeping with the Sunworm is now mastered as 
  well and has a huge sound. You will have to wait until summer to hear this one 
  though. We are planning on a special hand numbered digipack for this release. 
  We just had our gig in Tampere confirmed for Easter Sunday April 24th. We still 
  need a gig on April 23rd. We might play this Avant Garde music festival in Romania 
  in May. I will keep you posted.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Feb 1st, 2011</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Live at Roadburn has been mastered for vinyl 
  now by Johan from First band from outer Space. I still need to finish the gatefold 
  vinyl artwork. The Dead Man in Space mastering should be done shortly and we 
  hope to have this out on CD by early March. Some new gigs for March are up and 
  we now have a confirmed gig for Stockholm. We still are waiting for an answer 
  about playing in Tampere Finland in April. I will keep you posted.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Jan 6th, 2011</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Happy new Year. OSC have lined up some gigs 
  in Denmark for Feb and March and the Dead Man in Space CD will be mastered in 
  late January and we hope to have it out in February. We will see. The other 
  releases are in progress as well. I will send out a mail and post it on the 
  net when we get closer to pre-order time. Everyone how orders the CD from us 
  will also get their name in the inside of the Sleeping with the Sunworm CD that 
  I am working on right now! </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Dec 18th, 2010</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Well, 2010 is almost over and I would like 
  to thank everyone who paid to see us live or bought our CDs from the shop or 
  anywhere else in the world. OSC is going to unload a lot of material on you 
  all in the next year. This will include the Dead man in Space CD (limited to 
  500 hand numbered copies), Sleeping with the Sunworm (new CD), double vinyl 
  Live at Roadburn (300 copies on vinyl only), plus a new Kommun2 release on vinyl. 
  We have some gigs lined up but I don't think we will play out much more than 
  we normally do. I hope everyone has a wonderful christmas and that 2011 will 
  be a better year for everyone. Thanks for enjoying our music. Peace...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Nov 5th, 2010</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We are still out there and working on sorting 
  out all of the material that we recorded in the studio in September. Looks like 
  the first release from this will be out in March-April 2011 on vinyl only on 
  the Kommun2 label again. A CD will follow on Transubstans also in 2011. We are 
  nearly finished mixing the multitracks from the Roadburn Festival as well and 
  will submit this to Roadburn for the stream at VPRO. We are starting to get 
  some confirmed concert dates for 2011 now as well so check out the page. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Oct 7th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I hope you all have enjoyed checking out the 
  new music we have made, the Youtube videos, pics and diary. We just got invited 
  to what looks to be an amazing festival in Belgium next year called <a href="http://www.everyoneweb.com/shapeshifters/" target="_blank">Occultrance</a>. 
  Some classic bands from the 80's psych scene in the UK such as Mandragora, Omnia 
  Opera and Nukli will play as well as OSC and Dream Machine! There is also quite 
  a few other cool psych and trance bands. Looks to be very cool. Looks like we 
  will be back in Finland in spring next year as well for one or two gigs. Kommun2 
  will also release a vinyl release from our latest session by spring next year, 
  we hope. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Sept 27th</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We have the most fun studio session ever this 
  weekend and we recorded an amazing amount of great music that ranges from our 
  standard space rock to funk to jazz to country and of course eastern sitar space 
  outs. Wow... You all we will be very surprised. I have put up the diary and 
  pictures from the session. 2hrs of video was shot as well and Johan will put 
  up the best parts on Youtube soon. Several nearly full jams were filmed. We 
  have 3 guitars on most jams this time so it created quite a complex sound and 
  a lot of melodies. Some recordings from the room we were playing in were made 
  as well and I will put these up on the web page for a taster. Sound is not always 
  perfect and some instruments maybe a bit hidden but they sound pretty good... 
  Enjoy and please give us some feedback. A special thanks to Lars for putting 
  up with this crazy project and helping us make some great recordings.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to Rhona and Claus B&oslash;hling from 
  Hurdy Gurdy, Secret Oyster, Elektrum fame, this was an amazing night of music. 
  6 bands and a fantastic concert. Playing with Claus was a real highlight of 
  this band. We have never been joined by such a well known and respected musician, 
  one who has seen it all from playing in the 60's at the time of Hendrix, the 
  Jazz fusion of the 70's, where Secret Oyster were a contemporaires of bands 
  like Weather Report. and his own solo mostly instrrumental space rock band, 
  Elektrum in the 90's til present. I hope he will join us again soon. Anyway, 
  here is the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2010-08-28.FLAC" target="_blank">link

  entitled &quot;Glossolalia&quot;. It features only OSC music with sitar (played 
  by KG of <a href="http://www.sienaroot.com">Siena Root</a>) and Dan's spoken

  gig with us at the Psychedelic Network! Super special thanks to Horst for getting 
  us down to play for our amazing German fans. YOu were incredible. We played 
  a 2hr and 40min gig and had a blast. The whole thing was video taped and the 
  visuals were amazing so you OSC fans will have a special treat with this gig 
  as Klaus did superb vbisuals, some of the best I have ever seen. Just needed 
  some lasers and strobes and we would be in the league with Hawkwind and stuff..

  and they had to cancel so the audience got a 3&frac12; hrs amazing space rock 
  night with killer visuals by Flowershowers! He is amazing. Thanks to Steen for 
  video taping the complete show. This will be killer as I think it was one of 
  the best concerts we have every played. Diary, pics, music will be up in the

  Festival on 2009-06-26 (June 26, 2009)<br>
  Intro<br>
  Sent my mind into realms I hadn't thought about for ages, showed me ways in 
  which how to and how not...<br>
  Drumming is most seductive I must say,<br>
  Oh and the spacey synth, it wants to take me away, but then in again the guitar 
  strings sing back at me.<br>
  Woo the bass, tempting me from beneath, <br>
  There&#8217;s a voice<br>
  &#8220;You guy's seem ready to fly&#8221;<br>
  I am waiting in anticipation of the flight<br>
  The way the music has held me thus far, gives me the positive on look this will 
  end in a passionate embrace<br>
  Its building<br>
  The rhythms biting and up we go<br>
  Teased by the sweet divine melody he plays<br>
  10;43<br>
  Off we go<br>
  And the tribal drumming caresses inward<br>
  Slowly<br>
  Surely<br>
  We taking off<br>
  New patterns appear<br>
  Another direction amidst the organ entry<br>
  That grounds me once again<br>
  Once I land<br>
  Off you take me higher yes were flying now<br>
  Oh but you take us down again,<br>
  I want more<br>
  I want you to take it higher will you????<br>
  The song from the speaking guitar distracts the urge to rise<br>
  Content<br>
  In the abstract rhythms again<br>
  I groove to a decrescendo</p>
<p align="center">Finding the Path to enlightenment</p>
<p align="center">Dark and heavy vibrations amongst the soaring sythns<br>
  Bleeps come in messages showing the way<br>
  All participants embark on conversation</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Grassy faces</p>
<p align="center">I feel the desert in this piece<br>
  I am lost in the Nevada<br>
  Woo lovely after the trip up<br>
  You&#8217;re now taking us along<br>
  Bass heavy but light in his steps to ground us<br>
  Synth insisting we remember the rise<br>
  And guitar just expressing the love inside us all<br>
  Drums caught a happening somewhere back that challenged the heart to another 
  prospect.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
  Dedication fan jam</p>
<p align="center">Nice &amp;<br>
  Deep<br>
  With a country blues tone<br>
  A sci-fi western soundtrack, <br>
  Guitars work so well together a melting pot of real delight &amp; vigorous magic<br>
  Organ once more the anchor us to earth<br>
  Bass and drums talking in time carry us onwards as we sway higher now the space 
  synth reappeared<br>
  Lead comes in<br>
  Drums take control<br>
  We enter another zone<br>
  A running forward march<br>
  Takes us into a heightened state where synth voices hum<br>
  And now where really rocking, flying flying flying flying flying flying flying 
  flying flying flying&#8230;<br>
  Oh yes can I have more of that please&#8230;20 mins worth ;)??</p>
<p align="center">Short one&#8230;..</p>
<p align="center">We funk off, then divert to&#8230;.<br>
  Some vocals are heard sweet heaven<br>
  Into a deliciously creamy dessert of crushed iced T on the hottest day of the 
  year<br>
  Funk it, I&#8217;m downtown now<br>
  In the city of lights<br>
  In the heat of the spotlights<br>
  This is pure psych soul<br>
  Groove nation, cool as cool can be, love the drum &amp; bass here.<br>
  Pure indulgence<br>
  You can swim in forever.<br>
  The delicate glittering of the rhythm guitar beckoning all to a denser path<br>
  As pace synth enters we&#8217;re carried into a more dub vibe progressing into<br>
  A fast and furious explosion of all the above sent out at hundred miles an hour, 
  no waiting no stopping no holding back<br>
  Now is the time to let loose<br>
  And off we climb<br>
  The descent speaks of wisdom<br>
  We reach the first plateau<br>
  Turn around admire the view<br>
  And then we turn back and continue to climb<br>
  This time the descent becomes heavier<br>
  We are absorbed in the heat from the energy of it<br>
  Guitar lead brings in the conformation we have the strength to rise higher<br>
  And a deep breathe in and we reflect<br>
  Upon the next level<br>
  3rd plateau<br>
  There&#8217;s a breeze<br>
  It&#8217;s sweet<br>
  It&#8217;s calm<br>
  It&#8217;s bright<br>
  And it&#8217;s down deep and flirty<br>
  In it&#8217;s elegance to transport us into an orchestral sounds cape painted 
  with the final descent<br>
  Composed<br>
  Drums catalyzing the codes<br>
  We wait intent<br>
  Receiving messages from the bleep-age<br>
  We hear guitar echo of the breeze<br>
  And the window opens<br>
  We see the view<br>
  And we reflect again on the journey <br>
  Until we&#8217;re given the signal to GO!<br>
  To brace ourselves for the finale&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to all those who came out to see us 
  at the amazing Kildemose Festival. One of Denmark's best festivals! Only around 
  250 people, great location, amazing beer, cool bands, and just good people! 
  Thanks Jan.. YOu can see a few pics that I took but many more will be coming 
  as a lot of people took pictures. The soundboard audio you will be able to listen

  Special thanks the guy from East Germany (Halle) who drove all the way to see 
  us. Next week we will have our copies of the CD by <a href="http://www.facemop.com" target="_blank">Dan 
  McGuire</a>, where he put his own spoken word stuff over the top of our music. 
  The CD features 3 OSC tracks as well as several other bands. At the same time, 
  the multitrack mixes of Uppsala and G&ouml;teborg from last august will go on 
  sale as well. Thanks for all the support. We are coming to Europe finally in 
  Sept for at least 3 gigs. We are also confirmed to play in Finland again on 
  Oct 30th at Torvi in Lahti! More info soon.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hope everyone is doing well. I finally got 
  some of the jams up from our really cool session on May 2nd, our 51st. Sorry 
  for the delay. Enjoy. We are busy trying to get some shows set up for the fall 
  in Finland, Norway and Germany (Maybe Belgium as well). We really need some 
  help with Germany. Please write if you have some connections. The Full length 
  version of my Heel has a Beard will be featured on a <a href="http://melosprogbazaar.com/" target="_blank">Melo's 
  Prog Bazaar</a> compilation CD. Not sure when this is coming out though. I have 
  been mixing the Slottsskoggen goes Progressive concert this weekend and sadly, 
  one of the guitar players, his track is completely missing. Luckily, for the 
  last half of the concert we had Johan from <a href="http://www.fbfos.com" target="_blank">FBFOS</a> 
  joining us so the last half is quite ok. It is a really good concert. I will 
  keep you posted. Also, I have added a lot of reviews of our latest CD and a 
  couple of Inside your Head as well.. </p>

  heading off to the <a href="http://www.roadburn.com" target="_blank">Roadburn Festival i</a>n 
  Tilburg. Next mailing will be on Tuesday April 28th. Thanks. I can now confirm 
  that later this year our debut CD, will be released on a double vinyl pressing 
  on the <a href="http://www.transubstans.com/" target="_blank">Transubstans Label</a>. 
  It will include remastered sound and bonus material. It will likely be pressed 
  in only 300 copies. Also, we will have a jam session on May 2nd. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">&Oslash;SC will have one track on the upcoming 
  <a href="http://www.tripintime.de" target="_blank">Trip in Time</a> Vol 4 compilation. It is 
  the unreleased track Space Burst Cienma from our very first studio recording 
  session. Those who have bought the picks from Space Vol 11, will already be 
  familiar with this track. I had provided them with the full length version of 
  &quot;My heel has a beard&quot;, which is extended by around 6 minutes but it 
  was sadly too long. If we get Good planets are hard to find out on vinyl, then 
  we can include this full length version, as well as the full 25 min version 
  of MTSST! We might have another jam session on May 2nd with Johan from <a href="http://www.fbfos.com" target="_blank">FBFOS</a>. 
  I highly recommend you try to get a hold of the new FBFOS vinyl only release 
  called &quot;The guitar is mightier than the Gun&quot;. It is amazing and limited 
  to 300 copies. Finally, I will also have a contest for the first two people 
  who can figure out the original names of the tracks on the upcoming CD called 
  &#8220;Disjecta Membra,&#8221; I will send you a free t-shirt or DVD. You can 
  choose. It is not out yet. We will sell it in the shop as soon as we have it.

  does spoken word story telling over the top of some of our tracks. It is a secret 
  right now which ones (I don't even know as I sent him a CD with several and 
  I don't know what he has used). I will provide the link when I have it. Also, 
  the Swiss band <a href="http://www.phased.ch" target="_blank">Phased</a> have 
  finished their next CD called &quot;A sort of spamsic phlegm induced by leden

  these holidays and we thank you for a great 2008. Looks like we will be even 
  more active in 2009. Gigs in Stockholm, Helsinki, Norway, Denmark and Germany 
  look certain for 2009. The new CD will be out in a few months and is being mastered 
  this weekend by Henk Udd. I have added a new release to the shop. It is the 
  soundboard multitrack mix of our great show from the Danish Kildemose Festival 
  from 2008. We will play this festival again in 2009. Enjoy.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We just ordered our Tickets for the amazing 
  <a href="http://www.roadburn.dom" target="_blank">Roadburn Festiva</a>l. Wish we were playing 
  but maybe next year. Also, you can vote for us once a day to play at the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/swedenrockfestival%20" target="_blank">Sweden 
  Rock Festiva</a>l at this link. Another unrealistic goal but what the hell. 
  The next CD, Good planets are hard to Find has been sent off to be mastered 
  by Henrik Udd. 6 tracks, 79 minutes!</p>

  ACID Magazine</a> Issue #7 is out now! A really cool magazine that comes with 
  a CD with 17hrs of MP3 files and a huge high resolution PDF file of the magazine. 
  As an addition, is a DVD with a cool 17 min segment from Dragens Hule of the

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Wow..it has been a long time since I filled 
  anyone in here. Don't worry.. OSC stuff is happening. The first two sets of 
  the Loppen DVD are finished now and on one DVD. The video from the 3rd set has 
  been transfered. We also have the video from the Uppsala show on the computer 
  as well. Ole is transfering the video from the first two sets at Dragens Hule 
  to DVD now as well. Lots of video stuff coming next year. The next CD is going 
  to be called &quot;Good planets are hard to Find&quot;. Cover art work is by 
  a Swedish artist, Daniel. The final mixes are stuck in the fucking Danish customs. 
  Once I have these, they will sent off to be mastered. The CD should be out in 
  January or Febuary on the Transubstans Label. It will be our 5th studio CD. 
  Wow... We will plan to have a local CD release party in the new year. Some dates 
  in Norway are being worked on as well. A extended version of one of the songs 
  from the new CD will be out soon on a new compilation from <a href="http://www.myformicatable.blogspot.com/">My 
  Formica Table</a>. Watch out...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Oct 28th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I updated the Myspace page and added a few 
  teasers and changed out all but one of the songs. YOu can hear an unmastered 
  version of Jam 3 from our forthcoming record and also a small piece of a long 
  60 minute jam called Ultimate Space. This is the rough mix from the studio so 
  keep that in mind. The final will be amazing. Enjoy..</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Oct 20th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hope you are all enjoying the new CD and our 
  last concert.I have finally got around to uploading another recording of us 
  from Plauen May 2007 when we played for the German Grateful Deadheads. That 
  was a blast. I really hope we get invited back again! Any way here are the links 
  for <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2007-05-18.source2">Day 1</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2007-05-19.Source2">Day 2</a>. 
  I also just put up the <a href="Jam%20Pics/jampics46.htm">pictiures</a> from 
  our last concert at Dragens Hule. Thanks to Stojs! I also have his full recording 
  that I will upload to archive.org shortly. The big news is I just got the final 
  mixes of our next CD from Steve Hayes and it sounds great. We still need to 
  do some edits so that the 101 minutes will fit into 80 minutes. Find some song 
  titles, do the artwork and get it mastered so it is not ready yet! I keep you 
  posted.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to all of you, the few head trippers 
  who came out for the CD release party. We had a blast and it was a great musicall 
  night as well. It reunited us with some of the old OSC guys from Mantric Muse. 
  Anders joined us for sax, Steen video taped the first two sets and Sonja helped 
  with some nice lights and projections. Palle provided the mushrooms! What a 
  night. I hope some cool pictures will be sent to me soon for the web page. Having 
  problems with archive.org.. Show coming soon..</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I have put up two of the jams from the Kildemose 
  Festival 2008 that we recorded on our 24 track hard disc recorder. I have been 
  spending some time mixing these and they are not finished yet but you can at 
  least get an idea of the quality of the sound I hope all our future recording 
  will have. Enjoy and an extra special thanks to all those how have made donations,

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We hope everyone is having a great summer. 
  The new CD has been sent off to the pressing plant now and will be with us in 
  a few weeks now. We really hope that you will enjoy this one. I have added it 
  to the shop so you can pre-order the CD and I will mail them out as soon as 
  they arrive in August. No new show announcements at this time. The video from 
  the Loppen concert has been synced with the audio now and we just have to do 
  some menus and editing. Still only the first two sets though. I will keep you 
  all posted on our progress. </p>

  master for &quot;Inside your Head&quot; is due to arrive any moment. OSC played 
  a great, short, early morning set at Kildemose Festival and we will be back 
  next year.It was a cool little festival and really nice people. Special thanks 
  to Jan D for inviting us and Jan for doing the sound for all the bands. We made 
  our first successful 24 track recording (15 tracks actually) and I will start 
  mixing it soon. I will update the diary and put up pictures, etc. soon... NO 
  audience recording was made, sadly. More soon..</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Wow..we played a great gig last night in Sweden. 
  Pity only like 35 people, including the staff witnessed the event. As usual, 
  it was recorded. You can read about it, see the pics and hear some of the music 
  now. The concert is being uploaded to archive.org now and should be up tomorrow. 
  Sounds is pretty good and a very psychedelic show with four different guitar 
  players playing and giving the jams really different flavors. I was spaced out 
  as usual but I think we all played very well. Enjoy.. The Concert was dedicated 
  to Albert Hoffman.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Scott and the OSC</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>May 8th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Ok.. the NTSC DVDs are for sale now. Phew.... 
  sorry for the long wait... Artwork for our next CD, &quot;Inside your Head&quot; 
  is also finished now. We just need to hear that mastered version of the CD to 
  make sure it is fine and all will be ready for release... I will keep you posted. 
  Oh yeah.. I was just up in G&ouml;teborg jamming with the guys in First band 
  from Outer Space. I made a special web page for the <a href="FBFOS%20meets%20DrSpace.htm">jam 
  session.</a> It was a blast..</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>April 23rd</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello! Wow.. <a href="http://www.roadburn.com">Roadburn</a> 
  was totally amazing this year. Not that much space rock but great bands. It 
  was nice to meet some of you there. Keep up the amazing work Walter! You can 
  read my review at <a href="http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue39/roadburn08.htm">Aural 
  Innovations.</a> I handed over the final artwork for our next CD called &quot;Inside 
  your Head&quot;. Not sure when it will be out but within a couple of months. 
  Also, the people in Europe can now order the 3 DVD-rs we have produced in PAL 
  format. They are 15&euro; each or 40&euro; for the set of 3. The NTSC ones I 
  hope to have next week. You can now order the August 2007 one though as that 
  one is ready. It is a lot of work to burn these, cut out the artwork, number 
  and put them in the cases so I only plan to make 30 of each PAL and NTSC version 
  at this time. If they sell out I might do another pressing after the summer. 
  The DVD of the Loppen gig is going to take some time. I don't know if our show 
  in Malm&ouml; on May 15th will be filmed or not. We will try to go for another 
  multitrack recording for sure. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Looks like we will play a great Space Rock 
  Festival in Uppsala, Sweden in August with the Spacious Mind, First Band from 
  Outer Space, and Mass of the Sun! More details as soon as I have them.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>April 11th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hej Folks! </p>
<p align="center">I hope that you are all having a great Spring. I am finishing 
  up the artwork for our next Studio CD which should be out in less than 2 months 
  on the <a href="http://www.sulatron.com">Sulatron label</a>. It is 70mins and 
  one long journey made up of several pieces that were recorded at the same time 
  as the Black Tomato CD and mixed by Henrik Udd. A nice psychedelic journey&#8230; 
  It is likely to be called &quot;Inside your Head&quot;. </p>
<p align="center">I have also finally got the DVD-Rs ready to sell. The helsinki 
  and two dragens Hule gigs are ready. I have them in PAL format for all three 
  and currently only the August 24th, 2007 Dragens Hule concert in NTSC as we 
  have to re do the menus to make NTSC versions for the Helsinki and first DH 
  concert as we only made PAL versions the first time. The part of the delay was 
  in that the audio was only coming out in stereo and not in 5.1 but we have this 
  solved now (At least on my stereo system). </p>
<p align="center">These are going to be produced in 30 numbered copies. So they 
  will be limited as it takes many hours to burn these DVDs. They come with full 
  artwork and a small story about the gig in a half size slim DVD case (Size of 
  a normal CD case but thinner (7.5mm). The cases are due in next week. They will 
  go on sale the week after that. </p>
<p align="center">We have some gigs coming up and I hope some jam sessions as 
  well with some totally new people to see what happens.. I keep you posted. Thanks 
  once again for your support. A number of you will find your names in the special 
  thanks section of our new CD. </p>
<p align="center">Finally, Magnus and I hope to see some of you at the amazing 
  <a href="http://www.roadburn.com">Roadburn Festival </a>next week! </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello.. I can now confirm that we will have 
  our first concert in Malm&ouml; in 1&frac12; years on thursday May 15th. I hope 
  you will all come out and support us. We will be joined by locals from Carpet 
  Knights, Bland Bladen, Sgt. Sunshine and Drah von Trip. The show will be at 
  <a href="http://www.bodoni.se">Bodoni</a> across the street from KB. We will 
  start at 9:30 and play 2-3 sets. We have to finish by 1:00 as a reggae night

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">A really cool small CD-R and net label called 
  <a href="http://www.myformicatable.blogspot.com/">My Formica Table</a> asked 
  me to put together a compilation of stuff for them and I did. It is around 3hrs 
  of MP3 called Circiling around the Universe. It is a collection of stuff from 
  2004-2006 and includes the complete original promo CD we used to try unsuccessfully 
  to get some gigs. Enjoy... </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I hope everyone had a nice Easter weekend. 
  I just finished the Aug 24th 2007 DVD with Kim but something was strange with 
  the audio. Pretty sure we have it sorted out. If you are interested in any of 
  our DVD-Rs that we will soon release and can't play PAL format, please let me 
  know as we might make an NTSC version as well. I have seen the video from our 
  recent Loppen concert and it is really cool. We have the whole 3hr concert on 
  film (only sets 1-2 on DVD at the moment though). I keep you posted. More CD 
  reviews and pics from the last concert are up now as well. </p>

  This was a really cool show and the sound is really nice. A small problem with 
  a bad connection on the snare mic but you will probably not notice it. Great 
  mix by Sula Basanna. Enjoy.. We got invited to Swamp Room Happening to close 
  one of the night and get to play a long set but sadly they don't have enough 
  money to even pay our way there, so we won't play. Sorry to disappoint our German 
  Fans again.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">First off a huge thanks to all those who came 
  out for our show at Loppen on Friday. You made it amazing. Great thanks for 
  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/flowershowers">Flowershowers</a> for the wicked 
  cool light show and to Sergio for filming the whole show. I can't wait to see 
  it.. The sound guy did an amazing job so you are in for a treat. I have uploaded 
  some MP3 samples. During the 2nd song of the 1st set there was some mobile phone 
  interference or something so the left channel was totally fucked. I had to make 
  a mono to stereo convert of this track. Sound is a bit strange soundtimes.. 
  Sorry.. as it is a killer jam. Great to have Johan from <a href="http://www.fbfos.com">First 
  Band from Outer Space</a> play with us and also for PIB and Par to help out 
  in the 3rd set... Anyway.. enjoy.. and finally thanks to my great band mates, 
  you guys make the space rock wrold go round and I could not live without you... 
  I need to make music with you.. Thanks for being there...stefan, kaufmann, mogens, 
  thomas, sebastian, magnus, Luz...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello! I just wanted to let you know that I 
  have updated the Discography and added two new fantastic reviews of the <a href="blacktomatoreviews.htm">Black 
  Tomato</a>. Thanks to Andy G and Phil Jackson at Acid Dragon for being so enthusastic 
  about our music. You guys really understand it.. Thanks.. It looks like we are 
  not going to play in Berlin in March with Oozing Goo as there is not enough 
  money to cover our expenses and we have not other gigs, sadly. Sorry German 
  Fans. Still not gigs for Germany yet. I will soon be updating and changing the 
  shop so you can just use paypal. Soundflare (Band Site) have been amazing and 
  we enjoyed working with them but in order to bring our prices down, we need 
  to do it on our own now. With Soundflare taking a percentage of all the sales 
  and paypal also getting like 10%, we simply can't manage. New shop coming soon...

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Jan 17th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello OSC Fans and Friends&#8230;. </p>
<p>2008 is starting off pretty well. We just got our Alesis HD24 (24 track hard 
  disc recorder) and I am setting up a home mixing studio (pictures coming next 
  month) to mix the music we will make in 2008. Looks like we will play a decent 
  number of concerts as well. Here is what is line up and what we are hoping for:</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Friday- Feb 22nd, Loppen, Christiania, Denmark</font></strong> 
  (this is our first big local show and we really need to get a good turn out 
  for this gig if we are invited back again. Flowershower will provide a mind 
  blowing 3 projector space projections.. We will play for 3 sets and the line 
  up is the same as we had in Norway except the guitar players and Luz will join..)</p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Friday- March 21st not settled yet <br>
  Sat- March 22, Lovelite, Berlin with Oozing Goo </font></p>
<p>(these two gigs I just found out about last night and it will be great to play 
  in Berlin again. I am trying to find out what the band line up will be. I will 
  keep you posted.)</p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">April- G&ouml;teborg, Sweden</font> (We hope to play 
  on a Friday or Saturday in April before Roadburn). Nothing is settled yet. </p>
<p>May- Talk about going to Finland to play with Hidria Spacefolk but nothing 
  settled yet. </p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">June 29th- Kildemose Festival, Fyn, Denmark</font> (<a href="http://www.kildemosefestival.dk">www.kildemosefestival.dk</a>). 
  This is a small festival with like 2-300 people and Causa Sui, Cherry Overdrive, 
  Colour Haze (not confirmed yet) and us as well as several other bands. We will 
  likely close the festival so we can play for 2-3 hrs..</p>
<p>July- No gigs but we have sent out information requesting to play on the Freak 
  Stage at the Berg Herzburg Festival. There is also a great space rock festival 
  in England called Sonic World Festival with Earthling Society, Harvey Bainbridge, 
  Alan Davey, Omnia opera and many more bands. I have written to them. If you 
  know these people please request us. </p>
<p>August- Summer Party at Dragens Hule???? </p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Sept 6th Fehmarn Festival, Germany</font> (this was where 
  Jimi Hendrix played his last concert ever). We don't have a contract but it 
  looks like we will play at this festival!)</p>
<p>As for other things&#8230;. We have the Helsinki DVD-R and Dragens Hule 2-07 
  DVD-Rs finished with sync'd audio and menus but I wait to finish the Dragens 
  Hule 8-24-07 one and then I can offer them up as a package of 3 for a certain 
  price&#8230; Hope that is ok. If you really want one now, please let me know 
  and we can work something out..</p>
<p>Sulatron Records (<a href="http://www.sulatron.com">www.sulatron.com</a>) will 
  release a new studio CD in the spring (hopefully April). Dave is working on 
  the final track orders and will get EROC to do a special mastering job. </p>
<p>Steve Hayes of Secret Saucer is currently mixing the material we recorded in 
  Oct 2007 and that will be released in late 2008. NO idea what label. We might 
  release it ourselves. We will see.. </p>
<p>Finally, a huge thanks to all of you who made 2007 a great year for us. The 
  Black Tomato has been getting great reviews and everyone seems to love it. It 
  will be hard to top that one. The next two CDs are actually very very different 
  from the Black Tomato. Much shorter pieces of music. </p>
<p>I don't have much more to say&#8230; </p>
<p>All the best from the OSC&#8230;pass on the word&#8230; </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">2008 will see the OSC move into another sonic 
  space realm.. Thanks to all those who have donated and bought stuff from our 
  shop. In 2 weeks time we will purchase the Alesis HD24 and will be able to record 
  all of our concerts and jam sessions on 24 tracks. The big work will be mixing 
  this stuff and if you have some experience you are more than welcome to help 
  out. We just ask you send a hard disc and we will send you the tracks and you 
  can make your own mix! It will be a fun experiment.. Anyway.. more soon...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thank you and a Merry Christmas or whatever 
  holiday you celebrate. The OSC had a great year and got to play more concerts 
  than ever in 5 different countries, we have 3 filmed concerts, released a few 
  CDs and made even more friends in the world.. I hope you are ready for 2008.. 
  I just got the rest of the Oslo concert today so you will soon be able to hear 
  and download that. Anyway, two of the 3 DVD-Rs are ready now. I will put them 
  up for sale in after christmas. They will be shipped with artwork, info sheet 
  and small concert poster with the DVD, no case... This saves us all money.. 
  OH yeah.. we had an article in the Eclipsed Magazine and you can read the english 
  translation of the interview<a href="eclipsed2007.htm"> here</a>...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We are back from playing in Norway! We had 
  a great time and thanks to everyone (the few of you) who came out to see and 
  support us. Special thanks to Per Helge and Jon Lie in Oslo and Hans, Sigurd 
  and Lars in Trondheim. We will be back next year for sure...despite the hard 
  long 16 hr drive to Trondheim. Damn.. The diaries, pictures and MP3 files are 
  up on the net and the Trondheim concert can be dowloaded from www.archive.org 
  now! I am still working on the soundboard recording and I will wait to put the 
  Oslo concert up at archive until I have the complete 2nd set from Jon Lie. I 
  listened to the Trondheim concert today and it is a great concert. Very psychedelic 
  show with some monster grooves and a totally head filling, mind swirling spaced 
  out nature to it. Be careful.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I have just updated the Black Tomato reviews 
  page with quite a few more reviews. In addition, our pins and stickers arrived 
  today. YOu can only order these with another item in the shop, sorry to say. 
  The Sitcker is really nice quality black and white glossy. We are preparing 
  for our two gigs in Norway. I hope that some people will turn out for the gigs.. 
  I have some really bad news. Our current drummer PIB has reinjured his back 
  and is in quite serious condition. He will not be playing drums again anytime 
  soon, sadly. I hope everyone will wish him a quick recovery, but I think it 
  will be quie a long recovery, Anyway, our old drummer, Kaufmann from the band 
  <a href="http://www.blandbladen.tk">Bland Bladen</a> will fill in now for a 
  while. It also seems like we will have some jams with the ex-members of <a href="http://www.drahkvontrip.com">Drahk 
  Von Trip</a> as well soon.</p>

  in Germany has an edit of the end of the Black Tomato on the CD in the lastest

  The next double issue (DEC-Jan) will have an interview with me and some of the 
  others. I will post the link here, if it comes on line. If not, you will be 
  able to read the English version on our web page. Anyway, they are having a

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I had a great trip to England and saw some 
  cool bands. Just wanted to let you know that I have updated the Reviews page 
  and add a lot of the reviews (all we could find so far on the internet) to the 
  Black Tomato reviews page. Check them out....see if you agree or not?? We are 
  still working on the DVD stuff so please be patient... I think that is all for 
  now.. Thanks to everyone who is buying our new CD..</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Oct 13th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I have added the OSC Discography in a PDF format 
  for people to download. In addition, I have made some PDF files of some of our 
  concert posters that you can download in high quality PDF files. Though some 
  of you who have never been able to see us live might like some of these. Also, 
  you can download some promo flyers in PDF format if you want to help promote 
  us. Thanks.... Also, I expect to have the Picks from Space Vol 11 and 12 finished 
  in the next week. Phew... I can also tell you that with the help of Kim, we 
  have now made a DVD with menus of the first 50 mins of the Helsinki concert 
  with our audience audio sync'd up for better sound. It is pretty cool to watch 
  as the visuals (although a bit dark at times) are really cool and it was a spaced 
  out but not very exciting show. Not sure if we will sell this one or just put 
  a clip or two on the DVD-R we will sell. Write me if you are interested. We 
  try to finish the Feb 2007 Dragens Hule DVD next weds before I go to England. 
  We also will make one out of the 100 mins we have filmed from Dragens Hule Aug 
  2007, once I get the transfer back. </p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Phew.... I am tired. For us and also you fans 
  of what we are doing, we just recorded 7 hrs of jams in the studio this weekend. 
  Check out the diary and the pictures on the Session 37 links. IT was a great 
  time and a fun to bring a nearly totally new band into the studio and see what 
  happens.. It was amazing to have KG from <a href="http://www.sienaroot.com">Siena 
  Root</a> come down from Stockholm to play guitar, hammond and sitar! We played 
  some great groovy jams and not as spaced out. I think once we sort through all 
  of it and it is mixed, we will have a couple hours of great stuff. This stuff 
  won't be released until April or May next year though. I will put some samples 
  up that I recorded from the recording room with my Edirol shortly so you can 
  hear some of the stuff.. Thanks again for buying the Black Tomato CD and if 
  you are interested in helping us release our music on vinyl, please get in contact. 
  Time to sleep......</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Anyone like to see the &Oslash;resund Space 
  Collective on vinyl? I would but we just can't afford it. I am looking for some 
  people who might be interested in helping us to put our material out on vinyl. 
  I have the quotes for putting It's all about Delay out on as a 4LP set in a 
  glossy gatefold sleeve (2 records in each side) as well as releasing our debut 
  on a double vinyl. We will probably remaster It's all about Delay specically 
  for vinyl, if we raise the money. Please <a href="mailto:scott@oresundspacecollective.com">email 
  me</a> if you are interested. IT will probably take about 3-6 months before 
  you would get your money back. You will of course get free copies of the records. 
</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Sept 22nd</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Just a quick note to say that our debut CD 
  is officially sold out now. Transubstans and us do not have any more copies. 
  Thanks to all of those who bought one of the 500 hand numbered editions. You 
  own a rarity now. IF the CD is repressed it will not be in a hand numbered edition. 
  I hope that we can release this next on a double vinyl record though in 2008. 
  Just not sure there is the demand for it. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Ok... the first videos of the OSC from Session 
  29 is now up at You Tube. Check it out from our sessions pages in session 29 
  or search Oresund Space Collective at You Tube.. .Also are some studio clips 
  from Session 27 (in the diary) and a few shots from my digital camera (Thanks 
  Rene) from Plauen, Germany, Enjoy. Some of this you will see again on our DVD 
  but in better quality and the concert stuff will be sync'd with our better audio 
  sources.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I wanted to let everyone know that if you order 
  something from our shop, you will get your name in our next CD as a special 
  thanks for the support you give us. It is this money that allows this project 
  to go into the studio on a regular basis and keep putting out cool music. In 
  other news, we will not play at New Years Eve party but we have been invited 
  to Italy but I don't know when this will happen. I keep you posted. We also 
  hope to have Picks from Space Vol 11 and 12 finished soon. Vol 11 will be the 
  studio outtakes from our first, It's all about Delay and possibly the full length 
  13 minute version of Viking Cleaner. NOt sure yet. Vol 12 will include the best 
  of some of the recent rehearsal room sessions. We also have 12 tracks (110mins) 
  of stuff from the Black Tomato sessions that I am working with. Finally, I will 
  get some video up on You Tube by next friday...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">CD release party was a blast despite few people. 
  A few samples are up and the pics and diary as well. Enjoy this very psychedelic 
  show. Show is being uploaded to <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a> 
  now!</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 22nd</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The CD is due to arrive on Friday morning just 
  in time for the party. Those who have pre-ordered the CD, it will be mailed 
  on friday or Saturday. I know you all will love this one. People who have ordered 
  stuff recently have probably noticed a postage charge being added now. The price 
  to mail things from Denmark has become so expensive, we had no choice but to 
  add a small charge. Really sorry...It is especially hard for you in the USA 
  as the dollar is so weak versus the British Pound at this time.. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">In other news, we are trying to set up a special 
  jam session with Causa Sui in November and a show with Damo Suuzki in late Jan 
  or early Feb. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">All the best<strong>... Scott and the OSC</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 10th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello... the artwork and CD master was turned 
  in last week and we are praying we will have the CDs on August 24th for the 
  CD release party. IT looks pretty good. Anyway, here is a peak at what the cover 
  of the CD will look like:</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><img src="IMAGES/black-tomato-m-titel-og-log.jpg" width="209" height="180"></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">If you go to the shop you can pre-order the 
  CD now. Thanks to all those who have to help us out. We might be playing in 
  Finland on Sept 15th at the Earthdance festival. Looks like we have a gig in 
  Trondheim on Dec 1st as well. Looking to get a gig in Hamar or Lillehammer on 
  Nov 30th. If you have any contacts, please write... Hope to see some of you 
  at Dragens Hule in 2 weeks...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 1st</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">In August, we will release our 3rd CD as a 
  deluxe digipack, limited to 1000 copies. It is will be released and distributed 
  via Transubstans Records as have all our releases. It features Rumble (38mins), 
  The Black Tomato (32mins) and Viking Cleaner (6 mins) for a total of 77 minutes. 
  I think you will find that these are some of our coolest journeys in sound&#8230;. 
  I know you will like them. The sound production is the best we have ever had 
  (and I thought our other CDs had amazing sound!). Thanks to Henrik Udd for the 
  amazing mix and Hans for the mastering job! </p>
<p align="center"> October 5-6th, the new line up of the &Oslash;resund Space 
  Collective will hit the studio to record the next CD. The guys who from Mantric 
  Muse are taking a break from playing (but not supporting and helping us), while 
  Stefan and Thomas from Gas Giant are stepping up to fly out into space with 
  us&#8230;. We will also have a special guest playing synthesizers on the session, 
  but you will have to wait to read about it in the diary! Sorry..</p>
<p align="center"> We have about 90mins of some really cool video from our last 
  Dragens Hule show in Feb and it is likely that Steen will video tape our next 
  show as well. I hope from this we can put together some sort of DVD by the end 
  of the year. You will have to wait a little longer, sorry..</p>
<p align="center"> As for live gigs&#8230; here is what is on the agenda at the 
  moment:</p>
<p align="center">August 24th CD release Party- Dragens Hule, Copenhagen<br>
  Sept- Jam Session<br>
  Oct 18th- Possible gig in Malmo, Sweden<br>
  Nov 29th- Alternative Maiden Club, Oslo<br>
  Nov 30th- Gig in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden or Trondheim, Norway<br>
  Dec 31st- OSC New Years Eve Party????? Just an idea right now..</p>
<p align="center"> It is possible that Ozric Tentacles will play in Denmark in 
  November and we might play with them. It is also possible that Acid Mothers 
  Temple will play and we will try to set up a gig together.. None of this is 
  confirmed now.. Just rumors of things that might or might not happen. </p>
<p align="center"> Finally, starting around August 5th, we will start to accept 
  pre-orders for the Black Tomato CD. We would be very grateful to those who pre-order 
  the CD, as this money will go into our pockets and help to finance our next 
  studio session, further mixing of more material, our hard disc recorder so we 
  can make multitrack recordings of all of our shows and jams, etc&#8230; I promise, 
  I have the envelopes ready and will mail them out as soon as I have them in 
  my hands! </p>
<p align="center"> Also, we have a new pressing of t-shirts in and we have XXL, 
  XL, L, M, S and XS due next week&#8230; Phew&#8230;. </p>
<p align="center"> I will also try to finish up Picks from Space Vol. 11 (It&#8217;s 
  all about Delay outtakes). We have a final mix of Jam 9 and 14, which we had 
  no space on the double CD for. Our last jam of the night, 22, was also quite 
  cool but a bit rough in the middle and it might be included as well. We also 
  might add the full length Tony Blair witch crocket project, as this was edited 
  down to 15 minutes on the CD but runs a full 25 minutes and the last few minutes 
  is really cool&#8230;</p>
<p align="center"> Finally, it looks like Steve Hayes (Hawkwind, Secret Saucer, 
  etc..) will doing some mixing of the material left over from our last studio 
  session that Henrik Udd did not have time to mix&#8230; This is not certain 
  yet but there is another 60-70mins of some really excellent material.. shorter 
  jams&#8230;</p>
<p align="center"> Thanks again to all of you who have and continue to support 
  us. The Spaceship OSC could never fly and make it without the support you all 
  put into us&#8230; Thanks once again and I hope we can soon unleash a lot more 
  cool spaced out jam music for some great adventures to the other side&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Last night we played the last show of our small 
  tour to a small but enthusastic crowd. IT had quite a different flavor from 
  the other shows as we had a different drummer, bass player and a one different 
  guitarist. It is our shortest show ever at only 57 minutes but you can hear 
  and download the whole thing <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2007-04-12.aud.flac16">here</a>. 
  Lots of cool pictures on the web site as well. Thanks to all those who came 
  out. <a href="http://www.sienaroot.com">Siena Root</a> put on an amazing show. 
  Wow.. what a killer band. Don't miss them at Roadburn if you are going or on 
  the rest of their Europe tour. I hope that perhaps next year we get a chance 
  to space you all out at Roadburn. Magnus and I from the OSC will be in Holland.

  England for the gig), I look forward to us meeting again. If you took any great 
  pictures, please send them to us for the web site! THe diary and some music 
  samples are up now and a few pictures as well. I have also updated the reviews

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The OSC is about to go out on our first small 
  tour playing in Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen all in one week! We hope 
  that we get to meet with many of those whom we have corresponded with. Please 
  come out and support us. We look forward to playing with Siena Root at two of 
  the gigs and also our good friends, Hidria Spacefolk! Please bring your recording 
  gear, video cameras, and cameras and document our gig. If you get a some good 
  pics, video or recordings, please send them to us. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Also, the OSC is looking to find someone in 
  southern Sweden or the Copenhagen area who would like to work with us on developing 
  an elaborate visual show. If you are into visual arts, projections, movies and 
  want a platform to experiment, please contact us. Also, we are in real need 
  of a full time sound person for our gigs. We can not offer any money at this 
  time but as we grow, we plan to include this in our expenses. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">See you on the road next week!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Ok....OSC fans.. be prepared to get blasted! 
  Magnus and myself spend 2 long days with mix master UDD in G&ouml;teborg this 
  weekend and walked away with 3 massive mind blowing tracks. The sound is huge 
  and psychedelic. I think you guys are all going to like it. We still have to 
  finish the drum sound and do the mastering and final edits so it can fit onto 
  a 80 min CD, so it will still be a bit before you can all aurally taste the 
  BLACK TOMATO... Be patient and in the meantime, please try to come out and support 
  us on our 3 concerts in April.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Our fans are the best and this music is always 
  for you!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Magnus and I will go up to G&ouml;teborg on 
  March 23-24th to do the final mixing on our new CD with Henrik Udd. The new 
  OSC CD will be called Black Tomato. It will feature only 3 tracks (Black Tomato, 
  Rumble, Viking Cleaner). We are thinking about postponing the release beyond 
  May but we are not sure yet. There will be some major changes in the OSC line 
  up after the April concerts, which will be the last with the core of what has 
  been OSC since nearly the beginning but no worries. We still have killer players 
  (Tobias, Jocke, Mogens, Stefan, Thomas, Luz, Kaufmann (if his back is well) 
  to keep the OSC freak flag flying..Some people just need a break from playing 
  this intense music to recharge their creative juices.. all have promised to 
  come back...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">There is now a web site up for the <a href="http://www.germanheads.de">Playing 
  in the Band Festival IX</a> in Plauen. We will play for 2hrs on the friday night 
  and 1&frac12; hrs on the saturday night. I should also say that if you want 
  our first CD in the hand numbered edition, you should order now, as we have 
  only 10 copies left and the record company has about the same. </p>

  concerts. I have had some problems with the files that I uploaded because I 
  did not put the right file extension on the files.I thought that I had fixed 
  it but I have not. It won't generate the MP3 files of the little players. I 
  have taken the show down and it goes up again now and I hope it will be uploaded 
  by tomorrow morning (Copenhagen time). We will see. In the meantime, I will 
  put the rest of the show up as MP3's on our site so you can hear it. Sorry guys...

  (first 2 sets) and some of it was filmed. The projections were really cool and 
  everyone seem to have a good time. Warning.. very psychedelic concert.. Wow..

  (we hope), Helsinki and Copenhagen all in the same week! The bad news is that 
  the bastards at the Danish Post have raised the prices for mailing packages. 
  What used to cost 29kr now costs 45! That is outragreous, but I have had to 
  add postage costs to the shop now. We just can't absorb that kind of 30% increase.

  couple of great new reviews of &quot;Its all abour Delay&quot;. I was searching 
  the web and can see a lot of web radio shows are playing tracks from the CD, 
  which is really great. Remember to check the web site on Saturday to hear and

  the same time. First the good news. We will play our first gig ever in Finland 
  on Sunday April 8th at <a href="http://www.tavastiaklubi.fi/semifinal.php?lang=en">Semifinal</a> 
  in Helsinki with our great friends, <a href="http://www.hidriaspacefolk.st">Hidria

  next month as well. We will probably also have a winter party in Copenhagen 
  on Feb 9th or 10th and we are working on a gig in Malm&ouml; in March. We will 
  have our first jam session of the year next friday in Malmo and my good friend 
  and amazing guitarist from Gas Giant, who I played with some years back, will 
  finally join us. Watch out for some wicked space jamming! Look for some different 
  names in the jam session lists as some members will take a little break and 
  we will bring in some fresh blood. As for the bad news, I am pretty down about 
  my cousin, Cliff Heller, who died in a skydiving accident on Dec. 30th. We are 
  really good friennds and shared a lot of great concert experiences together 
  (Ozrics, Hawkwind, Eat Static, Funkadelic all in NYC) and everywhere I lived 
  in the world, he always came to visit and do things. I will miss him a lot. 
  Have a good weekend.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Also, we just were picked as CD of the month 
  at Acid Dragon in the UK. Also some more fantastic reviews have come out that 
  I will add to the page this weekend. Finally, we will have a winter party at 
  the Dragens Hule. Just us and some cosmic projections for 3hrs of space rock..

  on Jan 25th but this is up in the air right now and we are working on confirming

  weekend in the studio with Lars and Henrik and recorded over 6&frac12;hrs of 
  material. Read the diary and check out the pictures. I will work on making them 
  smaller. They look great but they are too big and load slowly now. Sorry... 
  I recorded some stuff inside the recording room with my Edirol and will give 
  you all a taste of 2 or 3 jams... Also, we shot about an hour of video in the 
  studio, which will appear at some point. The concert from last thursday is up

  out and helped us out with the party in Malm&ouml; on Friday. It was a bit of 
  a downer that so few people (30 or so) showed up and almost no one was into 
  the music. We have the coolest light show and stuff going on but no people. 
  It was a totally dead vibe. Anyway, please check out the music. It was a bitch 
  to EQ and get a decent sound and a damn dog fucked up the recording on the 2nd 
  set (See diary for more details). Sound is the best I could manage in this concrete 
  room with no people or anything to absorb the sound. Some nice pics of the evening

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I just wanted to let people know that the Oresund Space Collective are half 
  way finished with mixing our next double CD called &quot;It's all about Delay&quot; 
  with cover artwork by Ed Unitsky. It is sounding great with tracks ranging from 
  5 minutes to 25 minutes, with most around 10 minutes long. The new CD is really 
  different from our first one and a lot more upbeat and diverse in the sounds. 
  I think our fans will for sure like this one a lot.</p>
<p> We have just sent off a track called Waaaaaah for the <a href="http://www.musicstreetjournal.com">Music 
  Street Journal Compilation</a> CD that will be out later this year with artists, 
  Erik Norlander, Lana Lane, Don Schiff and Gak Omak and the OSC. I am not sure 
  when it is coming out. </p>
<p> I have also completed compiling the latest 3 volumes in our best of jam session 
  CD-R series called Picks from Space. Volumes 8-10 should be ready in end of 
  next week. I am just working on the last of the artwork. We will have a good 
  price deal for those who buy all 3 at once. </p>
<p> We will play our only concert this summer on the weekend of July 21-22nd at 
  our usual place, the Dragens Hule. We hope to be joined by the amazing First 
  Band From Outer Space, who have a killer new CD out very soon. We will make 
  a monster jam session out of it as well. </p>

  working with him on an <a href="http://www.alienplanetscapes.com">Alien Planetscapes

  encouraging and liked the stuff that the OSC was doing a lot. IT is a pity we 
  will never get to jam together but when we jam this saturday, it will be with 
  Doug in mind. Our next CD, which we are mixing right now is dedicated to his

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><font size="3">Well, I think all the OSC fans 
  out there are going to be blown away by the music we made this weekend! We recorded 
  6 hrs and 53 minutes of jams to 24 channels. The tape was running so to speak 
  when nothing was happening sometimes, so in the end we probably only have about 
  6 hrs or so of jams, only. The sound is totally amazing and have the PA set 
  up in the recording room worked so much better for most everyone and we really 
  played some killer hypnotic grooves and the sound is mind blowing... We have 
  enough material to make at least a double CD, perhaps more.. We will spend the 
  next few weeks digesting this stuff and trying to figure out what pieces we 
  should spend the time to mix properly. We will keep you posted and probably 
  put up a few teasers for you as well.. Another CD review has just been posted

  18.09GB of MP3 files downloaded from our site in Feb. Glad you folks are enjoying 
  the jams. We will keep them coming. I now have the multi track discs and will 
  try to put up some more from this session. Unfortunately, the files were all 
  accidently deleted so this is the only mix we will ever get and some stuff was 
  lost for good as it was never burned down onto CD. Oh well, such is life... 
  THe shop is back open and I will deal with some of the orders that have come 
  in. We hit the studio next weekend to make our next CD. I will have a diary 
  up soon after to let you know how it went. </font></p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Ok... we had a very successful Jam 19 in Malm&ouml; 
  last night and played for like 3&frac12; hours and it was all captured on multi 
  tracks (see diary for more details). I have put up some of the mini-disc recordings 
  while we wait for the multitrack mix from Jonas. It was great to be joined by 
  our friends Tobias (Carpet Knights), Kaufmann and Jonas (Kaabel) and G&ouml;ran 
  (Drahk von Trip). Also, the shop will be closed from Feb 17th-March 1st.. A 
  few more reviews of the CD had been added to the site as well. Enjoy the space...

  it out from the Sessions page link! </font></p>

  would like to thank everyone who came to our CD release party and bought the 
  CD and or a t-shirt and made this such a special night. Despite the ice and 
  -5C temperature, about 60 people came out and saw us fly into space for our 
  3rd live concert. We played 3 sets lasting a little over 3 hours total. It was 
  some of our best stuff ever! A few samples are up now and the whole concert 
  will be up on <a href="http://www.archive.org"><font color="#0000FF">archive.org</font></a> 
  in a few days. Thanks again to JOhnny for all the support. The CD is out now, 
  so please buy it and support us.. Also, the t-shirts run a little large in size, 
  so please keep this in mind when you order... Also, <font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.aural-innovations.com"><font color="#FFFF00">Aural

  can hear two of the tracks from the new CD as well as several great tracks from 
  our Pick in Space series, which I am burning now until we can afford to have 
  them made properly. </font></p>

  I picked up the CDs yesterday and they look and sound great. I am in the process 
  of numbering them all by hand. The T-shirts have also arrived and we will have 
  them at our concert on saturday. Please come join us at the Dragens Hule to 
  celebrate the release of the CD. We will play a full night of music as well. 
  More reviews of the CD are coming in all the time and I have added them to the 
  fast link page on the left side. In Europe, the fastest way to get a hold of 
  the CD is to order it direct from <a href="http://www.recordheaven.net"><font color="#0000FF">Record 
  Heaven</font></a> for 18&euro;, includes postage worldwide. It will soon be 
  sold in the USA at Aural Innovations and in France by Musea, and distributed 
  in Europe by Clearspot. Thanks for the support.</font></p>
