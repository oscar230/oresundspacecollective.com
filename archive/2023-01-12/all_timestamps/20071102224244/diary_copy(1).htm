<p><font face="Verdana" color="#CCCCCC" size="2">Well, we had talked about 
jamming together ever since we first met but this was the first time we actually 
did it and no one really knew that it would work so well and we would have such 
a great time. Magnus and I took the train over from Copenhagen. I brought the 
Nord Lead 2 and the Boss Effects Unit and Magnus just his Paul Reed Smith 
Guitar. Dave picked us up at the station in his van and we met the others. We 
also brought a case of beer as Beer cost half the price in Denmark compared to 
Sweden. We all set up and had some beers and a smoke and we were ready to play. 
Magnus borrowed a few pedals and played through an old Leslie Cabinet. It had a 
pretty ok sound actually. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#CCCCCC" size="2">We played 4 jams on this night, 
the first two were about 30 minutes each and then the next two 15 and 19 minutes. 
The last jam, was based on a new Bland Bladen song called Håralden, but we 
played it a bit slower and more spaced out. It was a great night and the 
recordings came out excellent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" color="#CCCCCC" size="2">After, most all of us went back 
to Kaufmanns and we stayed up until 5 in the morning drinking whiskey and Beer 
and listening to all sorts of cool music. It was a great night. </font></p>
