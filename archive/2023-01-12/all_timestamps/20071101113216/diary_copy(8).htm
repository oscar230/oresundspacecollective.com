<p><font color="#FFFF00">This was the debut gig of the &Oslash;resund Space Collective. 
  Everyone was in good spirits even though some of the members were not feeling 
  very well. We played with two other bands on this night, Dream Jockey and Tender 
  Prey. Both were a totally different kind of music but both quite good. The crowd 
  was clearly mostly here to see us (I think some thought they were going to see 
  Mantric Muse!). It was a very late night. We did not get to start playing before 
  1:30 in the morning and we played until nearly 5! We took a couple of small 
  breaks but pretty much kept the space music flowing and the people still wanted 
  more at 5 in the morning. The response was amazing from the people. The line 
  up of two guitars, two bassists, drums, conga-djembe, percussion, two synthesizers, 
  worked amazingly well. All of the stuff was recorded and sounds quite good. 
  We really were on a great journey this night and played stuff like we have not 
  played since some of the early jams sessions. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The music is broken down into 13 peices of music. Some 
  or all of ths show will be available. </font></p>
