<p><font color="#CCCCFF">Almost the same as the band on my Dead Earnest label 
  from the USA called Secret Saucer but here from Scandinavia and with a similarly 
  high pedigree plus equally adept playing skills. In essence we have members 
  of the bands Mantric Muse & Bland Bladen (2 instrumental psych/space-rock bands 
  from the area) and Gas Giant (a psych-stoner band) spending time - in this case 
  many hours - jamming and improvising together in the studio, then playing it 
  all back and sifting out the best bits for a potential CD release. The results, 
  according to this CD, are outstanding as over seventy minutes of instrumental 
  space-rock serves to testify. But, before you start thinking "heavy" or even 
  Hawkwind, let me tell you that this set of music features some of the most chilled-out 
  space-rock around, but that's what makes it work so well. It's almost like revisiting 
  some old, long-forgotten seventies Krautrock album, so much so that the spirit 
  of the most uptempo tracks on the first two Cosmic Jokers albums, appears in 
  your head on many occasions along the way. At the other end of the timescale, 
  so does the 'Spacefolds' series of CD's from the American group Quarkspace with 
  which some this also compares. With a line-up of 8 players on guitar, effects, 
  synths/guitars and effects/bass/bass/synth/Fender Rhodes and synths/synths/drums 
  - and with all 8 playing together most of the time - you'll hear a deliciously 
  flowing, multi-layered, multi-textured sea of instrumental magic, music that 
  just transports you to a different dimension in time and space but so easily. 
  There's nothing here that's going to blow your brains out, but in turn, nothing 
  here that's going to bore you into submission. The spirit of seventies Krautrock 
  is what pervades most of the music with that all-important human feel to what 
  ensues and a warmth, a sense of cohesion and people who are playing for no other 
  reason than because they want to. With three lengthy tracks between fifteen 
  and eighteen minutes, plus a clutch of tracks around the six-seven minute mark, 
  there's nothing on here that's less than absolutely riveting listening pleasure, 
  the sort of space-rock to which you float silently in space rather than power 
  up the engines and go supercharged into the cosmos. A gem, all the same. </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCFF">Das Øresund Space Collective ist ein Zusammenschluss 
  dänischer, schwedischer und amerikanischer Musiker, die sich nach ihrer Gründung 
  im Jahr 2004 zum Ziel gesetzt hatten, sich im Rahmen regelmäßig stattfindender 
  Jam Sessions einem improvisierten Space Rock Sound zu widmen. Ohne Gesang entführen 
  die spacig-wabbernden Klanggebilde aus blubbernden Synthieflächen, psychedelischer 
  Gitarre und einem groovenden Rhythmusfundament direkt in die Weiten des Weltalls. 
  Sicherlich kommen dem geneigten Hörer auf Anhieb die Briten Ozric Tentacles 
  als ähnlich gelagerte Band in den Sinn, deren Sound aber rhythmischer und weniger 
  jamartig orientiert ist. Die Mitglieder des Øresund Space Collectives setzen 
  ganz auf die psychedelische Note des Space Rocks und verbannen weitgehend geradlinige 
  Rhythmen. Auf diese Weise klingen sphärisch gedehnte Titel wie „Consumed By 
  The Goblin“ und „Falling Stardrops“ noch eine Ecke tranceartiger und improvisierter. 
  Dabei wird aber dennoch darauf Wert gelegt, dass man nicht in wüste, freie Klangcollagen 
  abdriftet. Genau zum richtigen Zeitpunkt setzt ein verbindender Groove ein, 
  der trotz aller bewussten Unstrukturiertheit für ein ordnendes Element sorgt. 
  Sicherlich kann man hier nicht von Kompositionen im herkömmlichen Sinn sprechen, 
  was auch gar nicht im Sinne des Erfinders ist. Vielmehr ist der Sound der Formation 
  voll und ganz darauf ausgelegt, den Hörer auf Anhieb in den Orbit zu katapultieren. 
  Von hier aus geht die Reise direkt in andere Galaxien, ohne dass sich der Hörer 
  in dem unendlichen Ausmaß des Kosmos verliert. Irgendwie scheint doch eine unsichtbare 
  Autorität gewissermaßen die Fäden zu ziehen und vermeidet somit einen strukturlosen 
  Soundbrei. Es steht außer Frage, dass die Variationsmöglichkeit solch eines 
  spacig-wabbernden Unterfangens rein kompositorisch von Natur aus begrenzt ist, 
  weshalb eine gewisse Monotonie und Wiederholungen unvermeidbar sind. Andererseits 
  ist dies ja auch gewollt und die Formation hat sich freiwillig ihr Korsett übergestülpt. 
  Letztendlich ist es müßig, über den wahren Gehalt von solch improvisierten „Kompositionen“ 
  zu philosophieren. In dem begrenzten Genre des Space Rocks wird sich das Øresund 
  Space Collective aber sicherlich als feste Größe etablieren können. Wem der 
  Pomp und die gelegentliche beschauliche Glückseligkeit des symphonischen Progrocks 
  aus Prinzip ein Dorn im Auge ist und den wahren Underground nur im weiten Feld 
  des Psychedelic Rocks sieht, wird an dieser CD-Version und den auf der Website 
  der Band frei downloadbaren Sessions sicherlich seine Freude haben. Leider hat 
  die Band mit dem die CD abschließenden „Sundown“ den Bogen aber doch etwas überspannt. 
  Ein auf 17:39 Minuten ausgedehntes elektronisches Krächzen und Blubbern ist 
  dann nun auch nicht im Sinne des Erfinders. </font></p>

  Collective</b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCFF"><br>
  The &Oslash;resund Space Collective is a fairly new band who have only been 
  around since 2004. Made up of musicians from Denmark, Sweden amd the US (and 
  who are also currently in other groups), these guys play an improvised form 
  of space rock and jazz that also hints at funk, prog, and reggae. Think Tangerine 
  Dream or Ozric Tentacles via the way of Return to Forever and Weather Report, 
  and you have somewhat of an idea what to expect here. Even though these are 
  improvised jams, the music never meanders, and for the most part sounds pretty 
  structured. 60's styled Fender Rhodes and organ sounds mix with fluttering and 
  chirping synths, while guitars explore into deep dark space and the drums &amp; 
  bass rumble and groove. Most of the tracks are fairly lengthy and allow for 
  ample time for the band to breathe, solo, and groove. &quot;Consumed By the 
  Goblin&quot; is one of my favorite pieces, with its 70's fusion feel and space 
  rock explorations. What's great about the music of &Oslash;resund Space Collective 
  as opposed to the Ozric's is that their music is not repetitive at all, and 
  the jazz &amp; fusion elements allow their songs to branch off in many different 
  directions, which makes for an exciting listen. A song like &quot;OSC Bolero&quot; 
  for instance, features tight rhythmic frunk grooves, but then the song branches 
  off into a light jazz fusion piece highlighted by a melodic extended synth solo. 
  If you like your space rock futuristic and haunting, these's plenty of that 
  as well, especially the chilling &quot;Falling Stardrops&quot; and the eerie 
  1-2 punch of &quot;Moonhead&quot; and &quot;Sundown&quot;, both featuring a 
  wide assortment of 70's styled synth and Fender Rhodes passages. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCFF">The band offers many of their jam sessions on their website 
  in MP3 format for listeners to check out for free, which is a pretty nice gesture 
  in this day and age. You really can't beat this studio recording however, which 
  is thoroughly enjoyable improvised music that pleases on all levels. </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCFF">COMMENTS & REVIEWS Nuno Published on: 17 Jan 2006 </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCFF">Öresund Space Collective is a multi-national band, incorporating 
  members from Norway, Denmark and the USA. They play, in their own words, a “Free 
  Form Improvised Space Rock Music”, this meaning that they get together and just 
  jam freely, within the frames of Space Rock, recording their achievements. Well, 
  if this album is representative of that, then I’ll just have to consider that 
  this band has developed an immense tightness between its members, a total understanding 
  of each other musicality speaking. Only this way would it be possible to release 
  such an album as this one, where the tracks are well constructed and seem like 
  results of much trained rehearsals. This is totally Space Rock, as all the instruments 
  transport the listener to those musical fields. From the guitars to the keyboards 
  and the paraphernalia of bizarre audio “noises” that are thrown in the mix, 
  many of them of a percussive nature. Being a totally instrumental album, there 
  are strong connections to some of the more spacey parts of Ozric Tentacles (mainly 
  the guitar and some inorganic sound effects) and Ship of Fools, but also to 
  Hidria Spacefolk or even some Hawkwind tendencies, while the keyboards strangely 
  (yet only occasionally) draw close tangents to the The Doors keys sound (just 
  listen to some keys parts in the track Consumed by the Goblin). The drumming 
  is competent and a bit more “direct” than the rest of the band, helping to keep 
  the resulting sound balanced and focused. The band takes its time to develop 
  the tracks, and in 3 of those it really expands that time to a mark above the 
  14 minutes, which allows the listener to levitate through a star-filled void 
  that the music helps create…like good space rock is supposed to, well…at least 
  this specific style of Space Rock. Like First Band From Outer Space or Ship 
  of Fools, Öresund Space Collective keeps things completely and uniquely on the 
  Space Rock side of things, with the correct and usual use of slightly psychedelic 
  sounds that come in the form of sonic effects oddities, which makes the album 
  not as much diversified as the majority of progheads want to (like myself, for 
  instance). But for the fringe of progsters that have a thing for the purest 
  form of Space Rock, and especially that which was able to transport this sounding 
  to contemporary grounds, this album will be a swell discovery, that I am sure 
  of. </font></p>

  sie stehen und dass sie sich für diesen Zweck zusammengefunden haben. Wenn man 
  dem das Wörtchen Psychedelic hinzu gibt, auf lange instrumentale Tracks hinweist 
  und als melodische und rhythmische Ansatzpunkte Funk und Jazz angibt, dann hat 
  man fast den Planeten, von dem diese Jungs aufgebrochen sind, uns zu erfreuen. 
  Die Band will es aber genau wissen, wohl, um Gast- und Stammzugehörigkeit konkret 
  zu definieren, sind die "Main Collective Members" wie folgt angegeben: Magnus 
  an Gitarre, Effekten und Synthesizer, Sebastian Gitarre und Effekte, Dave Bass, 
  Michael Bass, Scott Synthesizer, Ola Fender Rhodes und Synthesizer, Mogens Synthesizer 
  und Søren Schlagzeug. Die haben einen großen Proberaum - oder kleine Synthesizer… 
  Wenn so ein langes Teil gut unterwegs ist und Farbe bekommt, dann kann man die 
  liebevollen Details entdecken, mit der die Main Collective Members geradezu 
  verschwenderisch um sich werfen: gigantisch gute Bassarbeit (als herausragendes 
  Markenzeichen), sphärische Synthesizersounds, Geblubber und weitere Space-Sounds, 
  ein paar Techno-typische Synthie-Sounds, die wohl im falschen Kosmos gelandet 
  sind, ein fabelhaft federnder Rhythmus, schön dynamisch gespielte und temperamentvolle 
  Gitarrensoli. Wenn so ein emotionaler Part nach Minuten ausgespült ist, läuft 
  der Song weiter, spult sich groovend und flitternd ab, bis sich erneute Energie 
  findet, die Dynamik anzuschrauben und den breiten melodischen Improvisationsteppich 
  wieder anzufeuern. Die jeweils Viertelstunden von "Consumed by the Goblin", 
  "Falling Stardrops" und "Sundown" machen da am meisten her, während die kurzen 
  Songs in ihren etwa 6 Minuten gerade einmal das Thema ausgepackt haben und schon 
  wieder am Ende sind. Spacerocker und Psychedelicjünger werden entzückt sein; 
  der Fragenzeichen in die Luft guckende und sich am Hinterkopf kratzende verwirrte 
  Rest macht solange halt Abendbrot. </font></p>

  O.S.C. is a project made of musicians from Denmark, Sweden and USA from bands 
  like Mantric Muse, Gas Giant, Bland Bladen, Carpet Knights and Sgt. Sunshine, 
  an international one if we take it that way. Their music can be labeled as space 
  rock made of guitars, synths and drums, no vocals at all. Most of the synth 
  atmospheres are making me think of the '80's electro scene, mostly of the music 
  from films, but it has some organs a la '70's hippie movement, maybe Uriah Heep 
  or Jethro Tull kind of thing. All music sounds like a big premeditated jam session, 
  in fact they are upgrading all their jams on their site for free download, which 
  is impressive. This album right here is a studio recording of all of their best 
  songs so far. If you're into this kind of electro space rock with '70's and 
  '80's influences you will love this, so go find it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">This is the end result of the first studio jam experiment 
  by this Danish-Swedish psychedelic space rock group who put they trust on free 
  improvisation. Their idea is to get together about once a month to jam together 
  and have some fun. The line-up varies a bit from time to time, but there are 
  usually about eight musicians, any way. Three keyboard players can for sure 
  make some quite bubbling, buzzing and also melodic soundscapes. The rhythm section 
  creates a very groovy and airy background for the band, and the two guitar players 
  fill in the whole in a very nice way. There are some really great musicians 
  in the band, I have to say that. Their debut is rather relaxed, psychedelic 
  and instrumental flying from the beginning to the end. Even though the albums 
  was made very fast, they’ve got the sound right. There are a few bum notes, 
  for sure, but otherwise the playing is very fluent. The album is started in 
  a very ambient atmosphere with ”Faked It All the Way” that is based on synthesizers. 
  A nice beginning, and it already promises a lot. The floating but groovy “Consumed 
  by the Goblin” brings fourth the band’s strong Ozric Tentacles influences. A 
  really good track! The weakest performance on the album is “OSC Bolero” in which 
  the players seem to be a bit lost occasionally. Some breaks in telepathy? Still 
  not bad at all. ”Falling Stardrops” is one of my favourites. The track begins 
  softly and in a spaced-out manner. It has some really nice samples, and it reminds 
  me of early Porcupine Tree, Psychomuzak, Ship of Fools and, at times, Ashra. 
  The going gets pretty intense, and this track also has some of the best guitar 
  work. Rather wild stuff, and here the telepathy between individual members really 
  works. This, almost 15 minutes long piece of work is also danceable in a funky 
  way. Then follows the obligatory reggae part at the beginning of “Grap a Cap” 
  before the Psychomuzak/Korai Öröm styled dance beat starts. Really psychedelic 
  webs of delay and a groovy feel. This one also has a great ending. The short 
  ambient piece “Moonhead” creates a suitable mood for the last, massive space 
  journey of the album called “Sundown”. After the rain stick we first float peacefully 
  for a few moments and we get some rhythm too. After about nine minutes the track 
  starts to grow, and some Cosmic Jokers-like stuff follows. Excellent kraut-psych! 
  This rocks, even though the heavier guitars are still not there. Tight stuff. 
  The two wondering guitar solos sound nice towards the end. The very end disintegrates 
  into atoms, the drums disappear and there are only some arpeggios and other 
  great synth and delay stuff left. An awesome ending! We shall see what these 
  guys can achieve when they’ll get more used to jam in the studio. Now the guitar 
  players, in particular, had some difficulties with hearing, for example, and 
  stuff like this of course affects on the mood and thus also the playing. The 
  collective have been able to put together a unbelievably good sounding whole 
  by just jamming, any way, considering that everything was recorded in one day 
  and there were no overdubs. Everyone into instrumental and progressive psychedelic 
  space rock should get their copy of this numbered edition limited to 500. The 
  band offers all their rehearsal jams for free download at their web site, and 
  it’s also worthwhile to check out the <a href="http://www.aural-innovations.com">Aural

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Oresund Space Collective is a group of Danish, Swedish, 
  American musicians that shared time to make improvised space jams. The group 
  had occasional members from Danish bands Mantric Muse and Gas Giant and Swedish 
  groups Carpet Knights and Sgt.Sunshine. The group used to have more than 20 
  hours of material available on mp3 for download on their website for their fans. 
  This is their first official collection, and is a kind of best of. There is 
  some variation, from sequenced rhythmic synthesizer loops, to slow improvised 
  jams, partly led by guitars and drum rhythms, with Ozric like bass or space 
  dub reggae rhythmic influence. In general all improvisations have very much 
  the same elements like an ever going to infinite borderless directions, towards 
  space and beyond. Also, the improvisations are so relaxed and moody often these 
  spacey jams are almost like “ambient” space psychedelia. </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">La storia del rock non ci ha mai dato tanto in termini 
  di space rock, ciò nonostante questo termine risulta particolarmente evocativo 
  ed è diventato un vero e proprio genere con gli Hawkwind a guidare tutto il 
  movimento. Questa band si forma nel 2004 con musicisti che provengono da vari 
  gruppi della Danimarca e della Svezia, di qua e di la dal ponte Oresund, e anche 
  da altri musicisti a volte occasionali, la formazione in questo senso è elastica 
  e varia. In pratica si tratta di una comunità di artisti che vogliono suonare 
  insieme delle lunghe jam sessions in totale libertà espressiva, un esperimento 
  molto interessante che mi ricorda anche certe cose del nostro Paul Chain, in 
  particolare quello del “Container 3000”. Nella loro carriera gli OSC hanno suonato 
  dal funky alla musica psichedelica, con un impianto jazzato e una particolare 
  dedizione per la musica cosmica, un mix di divagazioni alla Klaus Schulze e 
  di progressioni spaziali tipiche del genere. Il tutto sorretto da una buona 
  dose tecnica che conferisce spessore al prodotto. Quindi non ci sono soluzioni 
  banali, ma tanta musica suonata come si deve. I sette brani proposti in questo 
  cd sono mediamente molto lunghi e difficili da descrivere in dettaglio. Sarebbe 
  sempre e comunque una forzatura, perché la musica degli OSC è totale libertà, 
  spesso molto freak e mal si addice a categorizzazioni. Ne deriva che chi li 
  vuole ascoltare deve predisporsi ad un viaggio onirico e visionario come pochi 
  altri. Un’esperienza metafisica che non può lasciare indifferenti. GB </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">By Gary Hill </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Overall Review: This Swedish/American outfit performs 
  improvised instrumental space rock. Now, mind you this really isn't Hawkwind 
  like space rock, but a more ambient, almost Tangerine Dream like version of 
  the genre. There are elements of Hawksound here, but also a lot of jazz and 
  other textures. The sounds are all interwoven into jams that move rather hypnotically 
  through instrumental soundscapes. This is cool stuff for just kicking back and 
  "spacing" out. You can order the disc direectly from the label at their online 
  store . </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC"><b>Track by Track Review </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Faked It All The Time: This comes in gradually and eventually 
  becomes a killer slice of fairly sedate mellow keyboard dominated space rock. 
  It has slowly moving waves of texture and sound that weave into a nice journey. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Consumed By the Goblin: While this one shares territory 
  with the opening number, it has a bit more oomph to it, and has a little bit 
  of a jazz element involved in its space-scape. This also moves into some intense 
  prog rock jamming with echoes of Pink Floyd and other bands coming and going. 
  This one gets much more intense than the previous one, and I like it more. It 
  moves through a lot of intriguing changes and really smokes at times. Late in 
  the track it turns a bit Hawkwindish. It also manages to dissolve into ambient 
  weirdness afterwards to slowly wind down and end. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">OSC Bolero: Well named, this is OSC's take on the famous 
  "Bolero " sound with Latin textures merging with a cool space groove to create 
  an effective and infectious jam. They even infuse some funky tones here in this 
  track that is very jazz oriented. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Falling Stardrops: This one starts much more slowly and 
  tentatively with weird keys and other odd space textures creating a mellow, 
  weird soundscape. This is the most dissonant of any track thus far. It grows 
  very slowly, and after a time begins to take on more rock textures with the 
  entry of percussion. This becomes quite an interesting rock groove that moves 
  well. Odd spoken sound bites come over the top, adding to the atmosphere. A 
  short burst of Nik Turner like sounds comes in at one point, then the band move 
  into an expansive prog/space excursion. There are more hints of funk on this 
  one, and it is one of the more effective jams to be found on the disc. The guitar 
  thoroughly soars through parts of this cool cut. This is another that at times 
  takes on Hawklike elements in its lengthy duration, but it's also very dynamic, 
  so doesn't stay there long. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Grab a Cab: A nice change of pace, this is a bouncy, 
  spacey prog rock cut with serious doses of psychedelia. It has some definite 
  strangeness in its over layers. As it carries on its path of emergence it begins 
  to resemble the more electronic jams of Hawkwind, at least to some degree. As 
  with the entire CD, there are no rapid-fire changes, but instead everything 
  moves gradually towards its outcome. I'd have to say that this is one of my 
  favorite tracks on the disc. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Moonhead: Super-science fiction oriented sound effect 
  type keys begin this one. They carry it forward for quite some time in a whirring 
  chirping sort of mode that only gradually begins to take on more musical formats. 
  It never really gets there, though, as this short cut seems to serve as intro 
  for the one that follows. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Sundown: Space keys start this in dramatic tones, and 
  gradually a guitar line that sort of reminds me of The Doors begins to work 
  its way up. It then shifts to something more akin to Pink Floyd, but still everything 
  is quite sedate to this point. Eventually new sounds begin to rise in a progressive 
  rock ballad sort of texture, but still ever so slowly. Then it shifts more towards 
  that Doors texture, building steadily on a droning sound in that sort of mode. 
  It never fully rises there, though; instead the keys begin to create an early 
  Pink Floyd like texture to carry it forward. That texture is never completely 
  realized, either, though, the cut instead moving into different spacey territory. 
  After a long period of wandering about, the Pink Floyd like textures, Meddle 
  era, coupled with Hawkwind like pure space, eventually move the track into an 
  effective groove. This still doesn't change quickly at all, but eventually moves 
  into something that has those same two elements, but with a bit of the Grateful 
  Dead thrown in for good measure. I also hear a lot of Hall of the Mountain Grill 
  era Hawkwind here. It eventually dissolves back down to more pure space to carry 
  forward and eventually end the track. At over 17 and a half minutes in length 
  this is the longest track on the disc. It's also the least cohesive and therefore 
  not exactly the best choice for a disc closer. Still, the latter parts of the 
  cut are the strongest, therefore pulling it together just in time. </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">The Histroy of rock has never given us much in terms 
  of space rock. IN spite of the term and what it conjures up, it has become a 
  real genre with Hawkwind at the head of the movement. This band was founded 
  in 2004 with musicians from different groups in Denmark and Sweden from both 
  sides of the &Oslash;resund Bridge. Also, occasional the band is joined by other 
  musicians, and in this way the group is elastic and various. We are talking 
  about a community of artists which want to play together long jam sessions with 
  a complete freedom of expression that reminds me in some aspects of Paul Chain, 
  especially the one &quot;Container 3000&quot;. During their career, the OSC 
  has played from funky to psychedelic music with a jazzy approach and a particular 
  devotion to the cosmic music, ala Klaus Schulze and of a special progression 
  typical of this genre. All this is supported by a good does of technique that 
  gives substance to the product. Therefore, there is no balanced solutions but 
  a lot of music played as music should be played. The 7 pieces proposed in this 
  CD are on average very long and difficult to describe in details. IT would in 
  anyway be forcing... The music of OSC is total freedom, often very freaked out, 
  and it doesn't fit to categorization, that means that if you want to listen 
  to this music you have to prepare yourself for a dreamy and visionary trip, 
  as there are few of these trips to be had. A metaphysical experience that can't 
  leave you unimpressed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC"><b>Daniel Lars -(from <a href="http://daniellars.com/">Long 
  Gone</a>) review on Oresund Space Collective's 1st Studio cd- 2006 </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">First and foremost - Space rock is a "lost art" these 
  days, find there's very few bands keeping it alive, Oresund Space Collective 
  is truly one of those bands! Was honored to receive a limited edition (13 of 
  500) copy of Oresund Space Collective's first live studio jam cd from my friend, 
  Scott Heller. Hadn't smoked herb for a few weeks (which I'm glad I saved), and 
  had some special leftover herb that was still in my bong. After reading the 
  liner notes (thanks for having my name in there too) and recommendations to 
  get in the zone for this recording, it was time to pull the bong out and smoke 
  the rest of what I had left (especially after the first song started). Had quite 
  a good buzz due to not getting stoned for a while, along with some fine red 
  wine, to put me out to space. If one has a analog/tube stereo amp or receiver 
  (the only source I now listen to music), you're going to be in for a real treat!! 
  But on any type of stereo, this recording is well produced for a live studio 
  jam! The production on this recording is excellent, the balance between the 
  highs and lows are well done. Also considering Scott Heller only had 8 hours 
  to mix down 90 minutes of music, it was quite impressive!! The keyboard work 
  & space effects/sounds from Scott Heller, Mogens, & Ola is excellent! They put 
  the right essense of sounds & magic in the right places on all of the tracks. 
  It reminded me of older Tangerine Dream, Ashra Temple, Steve Hillage, and even 
  a tad of Passport's first two LPs. Both Bass players Dave & Michael lock a great 
  groove with their drummer S&oslash;ren. S&oslash;ren is a clock in regards to 
  his timing. His playing is very impressive, including both bass players! The 
  first track "Faked It All The Way & Consumed by the Goblin"," are two nice opening 
  tracks to get one ready for what's to come ahead. It reminded me a lot of the 
  older Steve Hillage material that I always enjoyed. "OSC Bolero" has the Egyptian 
  vibe going on, and leaves the listener wanting it to go on for at least another 
  few minutes. Personally I find it's sometimes nice to leave one hungry for more 
  instead of going on too long. Now the fourth track "Falling Stardrops" knocked 
  me way out to space (the herb had really kicked in too), and was one of my favorite 
  tracks! These guys are really pumped & locked in here, giving it all to the 
  space psych rock listener! Killer track...loved it! "Grab A Cab" really reminded 
  me of Ashra, and was a nice song to come back a little in Orbit, after the previous 
  song. Moonhead is a killer short "dark" space rock song, and I love that dark 
  vibe in any type of psychedelic music! It gets one ready for another travel 
  way out to space again, with this track. The final track "Sundown" is a great 
  ending song on the disc, which one travels way beyond the galaxy. It's quite 
  a killer space ride to end with this track too! This is a disc that I'm quite 
  proud to have in my collection, and it will always be something I can enjoy 
  for many years to come. All the songs go well together, and there's not a song 
  on here that one would want to skip to the next track. Rarely come across modern/current 
  bands that do justice to Space Rock, Oresund Space Collective is on the top 
  of my list. Hey guys...need some of the special herb you were smoking, that 
  inspire you to do this excellent recording...lol! Cheers & 5 Stars for Oresund 
  Space Collective!!! - Daniel Lars </font> </p>

  (69:47, Transubstans Records, 2005) </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Mit Musikern aus Dänemark, Schweden und den U.S.A., respektive 
  ex-Mitgliedern der Bands Mantric Muse, Gas Giant und Bland Bladen, wurde 2004 
  das Ørseund Space Collective aus der Taufe gehoben. Von Anfang an verschrieb 
  man sich dem frei improvisierten Space Rock, schnitt jede Session mit und machte 
  sie über die eigene Homepage zum freien Download verfügbar. Inzwischen haben 
  sich über 20(!) Stunden Material angesammelt, durch die man sich als Hörer durchkämpfen 
  kann. Ihr erster offizieller Longplayer vereint nun die besten Momente aus diversen 
  Sessions und soll auch als Visitenkarte dienen, um sich für Konzerte und für 
  eine breitere Hörerschaft zu empfehlen. Das Musikerkollektiv aus den verschiedenen 
  Ländern gibt zwar Space Rock als Grundrichtung vor, jedoch finden sich beim 
  ausgiebigen Improvisieren immer wieder auch andere Stil-Elemente, die von Reggae, 
  Jazz Rock, Psychedelic bis hin zu leichten Funk Einflüssen reichen. Meist aufgebaut 
  auf fließende, sphärische Keyboardklänge, schält sich langsam ein Rhythmus hervor, 
  über dem abwechselnd die verschiedenen Musiker solistisch agieren. So werden 
  mal sachte, mal verzerrte Gitarrenlinien durch eindringliche Orgelklänge abgelöst, 
  groovt sich der Bass seinen Weg, wobei dennoch das Material auf seine Art sehr 
  dicht und kompakt wirkt. Jede Menge spacige Sounds und Effekte sorgen dabei 
  für raumgreifende Klanggemälde aus ganz anderen Sphären. Der Ansatz der multi-internationalen 
  Band erinnert bisweilen an die amerikanischen Kollegen von Quarkspace, die sich 
  auf ihren "Spacefolds" Alben ebenfalls improvisativ austoben. Auf CD Länge ist 
  das Zusammenspiel der sechs Musiker über weite Strecken durchaus spannend anzuhören, 
  auch wenn manche Passagen unweigerlich Längen aufweisen und bei durchstrukturierter 
  Herangehensweise einige Straffungen nötig wären. Ansonsten kann die Truppe durchaus 
  einige Sympathiepunkte gewinnen und man kann ihnen für ihren Ansatz durchaus 
  geschmackvolles und stilsicheres Zusammenspiel attestieren. Kristian Selm </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Øresund Bridge links Sweden and Denmark and it's rightly 
  considered as a so important public service for the commercial exchanges between 
  the two scandinavian countries. Maybe you're not interested about it, but I 
  will tell you even more: on the Øresund Bridge website I read the traffic on 
  the bridge increased of about the 13,7% last year and I think to know the reason 
  why. Since the first months of 2004, some danish and swedish musicians have 
  been crossing the bridge in turns to meet themselves in Malmo and København 
  and improvise long space/psychedelic-rock jams. The Øresund Space Collective 
  was just born this way, formed by members of Mantric Muse, Gas Giant and Bland 
  Bladen with occasional contributions of Carpet Knights and Sgt. Sunshine musicians. 
  This eponymous album just picks up the most juicy fruits matured during those 
  several jam sessions, seven instrumental long tracks very well recorded. "Faked 
  It All The Way" is nothing more than an atmospheric introduction but the following 
  "Consumed By The Goblin" starts to show the great potential of the band. Try 
  to imagine Ozric Tentacles with less distorted guitar parts and less sound effects 
  but with the same oriental echoes and reggae influence. That's pure Space-rock, 
  very well played, full of hypnotic rhythms and groove. "Falling Stardrops" and 
  "Moonhead" will take your breath away with adventurous sound trips in the vein 
  of the "Voyage 34" by Porcupine Tree. The ending track "Sundown" is maybe the 
  most unuseful, with few interesting ideas to show. Finally, the band seems to 
  agree the file sharing : infact you can download for free tons of jams directly 
  from their own web site (www.oresundspacecollective.com). The Mp3 quality is 
  good but not excellent, so I think your OSC's knowledge should pass through 
  the purchase of this very good cd. The "Øresund Space Trip" has just begun: 
  please, fasten your seat belts and free your mind !! </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">The actual music behind these improvisations are dreamed 
  up and performed by a collective of far spaced out Scandinavian ( Oresund is 
  a 16km bridge connecting Sweden to Denmark) musicians, who are current and former 
  members of Bland Bladen, Gas Giant, Mantric Muse… Seven tracks take us on a 
  70 minute trip into the interstellar space with well used influences from Psychomuzak, 
  Ozric Tentacles, Brainticket, Harvey Bainbridge, Klaus Schulze or even the “Meddle”-period 
  of Pink Floyd. The instrumental nirvana “Consumed by the goblin” is cosmic space 
  rock, to which brushstrokes of kraut, progressive, ethnic and jazz rock are 
  added ..“Falling stardrops” has a heavy dub bass groove with loads of acid laced 
  echo guitarsolos and the most delicious atmospheric keyboard work with a sniff 
  of lsd-drenched influenced lyrics your ears could tolerate. Fans of ambient 
  electronica like The Orb and Astralasia might want to give the last song “Sundown” 
  a listen as well. Enter the "Turn On, Tune In, drop Out" -zone of www.oresundspacecollective.com 
  and download the collective records of all of the jam sessions, over 12 hours 
  of material, for free. In between those jam improvs you’ll get a taste of all

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Here’s the deal with this collective. OSC is a company 
  of like minded musicians, hailing from Sweden, Denmark (Oresund is the 16km 
  long bridge that connects the two countries) and USA, that enjoy getting together, 
  smoking up and busting some really lengthy space rock jams. Sounds pretty cool, 
  no? These jams are almost always recorded and available for downloading at the 
  band’s site. For their official debut, this habit hasn’t changed much, OSC followed 
  their usual ritual and just applied a few edits to the recording so the album 
  could be more "refined" let’s say. As you might have guessed so far, innovation 
  is the name of the game. 7-8 musicnauts bring their ideas to the table and blend 
  them on the spot. These ideas range from electronic to jazz music with space 
  rock as the main focus. The amazing thing with this group though is that the 
  chemistry between all the players actually works. Despite the many different 
  elements that each member delivers the cohesion never falls off, not even for 
  a bit. Hence some really great psychedelic journeys, made from the stuff that 
  can elevate consciousness. Both theirs and ours. Take the closing song, Sundown 
  for example. Clocking it at more than 17 minutes, it’s a - Pink Floyd meets 
  Ozrics - space fusion that makes it pretty difficult for the listener not to 
  zone out while it’s playing. The rest of the material walks on the same cosmic 
  corridor. Synth and guitar based instrumental workouts that flow towards the 
  infinite and lure your mind along. Not much to add, you caught my drift most 
  likely and already are in the process of downloading their free (in every sense 
  of the word) jams. www.oresundspacecollective.com </font></p>

  (Record Heaven - Transubstans) </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Öresund Space Collective is a multi-national band, incorporating 
  members from Norway, Denmark and the USA. They play, in their own words, a "Free 
  Form Improvised Space Rock Music", this meaning that they get together and just 
  jam freely, within the frames of Space Rock, recording their achievements. Well, 
  if this album is representative of that, then I'll just have to consider that 
  this band has developed an immense tightness between its members, a total understanding 
  of each other musicality speaking. Only this way would it be possible to release 
  such an album as this one, where the tracks are well constructed and seem like 
  results of much trained rehearsals. This is totally Space Rock, as all the instruments 
  transport the listener to those musical fields. From the guitars to the keyboards 
  and the paraphernalia of bizarre audio "noises" that are thrown in the mix, 
  many of them of a percussive nature. Being a totally instrumental album, there 
  are strong connections to some of the more spacey parts of Ozric Tentacles (mainly 
  the guitar and some inorganic sound effects) and Ship of Fools, but also to 
  Hidria Spacefolk or even some Hawkwind tendencies, while the keyboards strangely 
  (yet only occasionally) draw close tangents to the The Doors keys sound (just 
  listen to some keys parts in the track Consumed by the Goblin). The drumming 
  is competent and a bit more "direct" than the rest of the band, helping to keep 
  the resulting sound balanced and focused. The band takes its time to develop 
  the tracks, and in 3 of those it really expands that time to a mark above the 
  14 minutes, which allows the listener to levitate through a star-filled void 
  that the music helps create... like good space rock is supposed to, well... 
  at least this specific style of Space Rock. Like First Band From Outer Space 
  or Ship of Fools, Öresund Space Collective keeps things completely and uniquely 
  on the Space Rock side of things, with the correct and usual use of slightly 
  psychedelic sounds that come in the form of sonic effects oddities, which makes 
  the album not as much diversified as the majority of progheads want to (like 
  myself, for instance). But for the fringe of progsters that have a thing for 
  the purest form of Space Rock, and especially that which was able to transport 
  this sounding to contemporary grounds, this album will be a swell discovery, 
  that I am sure of. </font></p>

  this grouping. The musicianss are evidently competent, do not scrimp on energy

  that the disc becomes boring monotonous. Some references to the Pink Floyd but

  <b>ORESUND SPACE COLLECTIVE</b> (OSC hereinafter) is a kind of Scandinavian 
  supergroup, as the project comprises current and former members of several bands 
  from Sweden and Denmark, all of which, according to the CD press kit, are well 
  known in their countries. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC"><br>
  Analysis.<br>
  OSC describe their music as free-improvisational Space Rock. This statement 
  suggests they perform nothing else but Space Fusion, which is true in most cases, 
  but is sometimes not true at all. Faked It All the Way and Moonhead, both of 
  which are excessively overloaded with synthesizer effects and feature neither 
  drums nor tempo changes, are closer to electronic space music than to Space 
  Rock, let alone Space Fusion. The other five tracks are much more expressive, 
  although the band's approach isn't new and was previously applied by the likes 
  of Djam Karet, Pseudo Buddha and Escapade along with many others. Four members 
  handle the keyboards, and although they are normally well supported by other 
  musicians (two bassists, three guitarists and a drummer), synthesizers remain 
  the primary soloing force in most cases. The first two of the longer pieces: 
  Consumed by the Goblin and Falling Stardrops begin slowly, as the players grope 
  their way to gradually increase the speed to finally merge into one intense 
  jam, which normally happens somewhere in the middle, the further arrangements 
  developing in different ways (atmospheric and relative transparent textures 
  alternating with dense ones etc), but always with enough intricacy and drive 
  to keep the stuff sounding interesting. Overall, it's much the same with the 
  longest track, Sundown, but the guys are somewhat slower to get moving this 
  time out, besides which they quite quickly get exhausted after reaching a culmination. 
  I don't want to say the piece is boring, but it is in many ways inferior to 
  the previously described ones, both of which can easily be considered masterworks 
  within their genre category. On OSC Bolero and Grab a Cab the band keeps a moderately 
  intense pace throughout, showing a mellower and, at the same time more symphonic 
  approach, the former track having a light (at times barely perceptible) oriental 
  feel to it. <br>
  Conclusion.<br>
  While the spacey electronic minimalism of Faked It All the Way and Moonhead 
  may seriously mar the listener's impression, overall, this album is an interesting 
  specimen of modern psychedelic Space Fusion and should satisfy anyone interested 
  in this kind of progressive music. </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">The Review:</font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Oresund Space Collective is a international group comprised 
  of Danish, Swedish, American musicians that have come together to compose well 
  improvised modern space jams. The group had occasional members from Danish bands 
  Mantric Muse and Gas Giant and Swedish groups Carpet Knights and Sgt.Sunshine.<br>
  The band&#146;s sound is very similar to Ozric Tentacles but with a bit more 
  flavor to the arrangements They combine trippy synthesizer loops, slow improvised 
  jams, almost reggae rhythms to put some of the most enjoyable instrumental music 
  I&#146;ve heard in along while. Even though the music isl improvised it has 
  a well structured feel to it. The music has a relaxed feeling to it but enough 
  energy to it that keeps you wanting hear what they&#146;ll do next. According 
  to the band's website, this is a limited edition run so get your copy as soon 
  as possible!</font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">&Oslash;resund Space Collective er en konstellasjon, 
  best&aring;ende av svenske, danske og amerikanske musikere, som baserer sitt 
  utgangspunkt p&aring; noe s&aring; spesielt som total-improvisert spacerock. 
  Gruppa ble dannet i 2004 og best&aring;r av medlemmer med bakgrunn fra danske 
  band som Mantric Muse og Gas Giant, samt svenske grupper som Bland Bladen og 
  Carpet Knights. Utgangspunktet er alts&aring; jamsessions, et konsept de ogs&aring; 
  har tatt for seg i liveformat og som har resultert i noen virkelig kosmiske 
  happenings med varighet p&aring; flere timer. Denne utgivelsen er trykket opp 
  i et begrenset opplag p&aring; 500 eksemplarer. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Ved avnytelse av deres f&oslash;rste offisielle CD f&oslash;res 
  tankene i retning tysk, kosmisk musikk som f.eks. Cosmic Jokers, men &Oslash;resund 
  Space Collective gj&oslash;r sin moderne variant av denne musikkformen og fletter 
  inn elementer fra ambient/elektronisk-, dub/reggae-, funk- og jazzorientert 
  musikk som de tilf&oslash;rer deres spacerock. Det oser lidenskap av hele produksjonen 
  og det er tydelig at musikerne befinner seg p&aring; samme musikalske/kjemiske 
  (he-he&#133;) b&oslash;lgelengde for det g&aring;r ganske smidig avg&aring;rde 
  hele veien. Resultetet er imponerende med tanke p&aring; at dette dreier seg 
  om rendyrket improvisasjon. Det er slett ikke alle band forunt &aring; lyde 
  s&aring;pass inspirert p&aring; jamsessions!</font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Lydbildet er sterkt farget av flyvende synthtepper, dertilh&oslash;rende 
  kosmiske lydeffekter, glidende gitarer, ekkogitarer, s&aring;gar ogs&aring; 
  glissandogitarer ala f.eks. Gong og heftige trommer. Tidvis holder de p&aring; 
  de samme stemningene over lengre tidsrom, andre ganger spiller de p&aring; en 
  &oslash;kende grad av intensitet underveis. Musikalsk befinner de seg et sted 
  midt i mellom Cosmic Jokers, Tangerine Dream og Ozric Tentacles. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Kjedes du lett av jamming tviler jeg p&aring; om dette 
  er din greie. Har du derimot sans for ideen av &aring; flyte avg&aring;rde p&aring;

  spontane slaget, er det bare &aring; ta plass! God reise&#133;</font></p>

  If you want some spacey chill-out music, the &Ouml;RESUND SPACE COLLECTIVE are 
  the way to go. With members hailing from Denmark, Sweden and the USA and coming 
  from bands such as MANTRIC MUSE, GAS GIANT, BLAND BLADEN, CARPET KNIGHTS and 
  SGT. SUNSHINE, this group comes together with one goal in mind: to record completely 
  improvised Space Rock music built around a core of guitar, bass, drums and at 
  least four guys on synthesizers. That's a lot of synth.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">What you get with the band's debut studio album is seven 
  sprawling, loose compositions that sound a lot like the more psychedelic, jammed-out 
  parts from any given PINK FLOYD album. There's a lot of noodling and a lot of 
  strange noises, not a lot of &quot;in your face&quot; rocking out. Really, the 
  whole bit is rather subdued, making this a good album to put on as background 
  music while your mind is elsewhere.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">If you're looking for something calming, not very heavy 
  and thoroughly tripped-out, check out the &Ouml;RESUND SPACE COLLECTIVE. This 
  is not a record for every occasion, but when that rare mood strikes, this will 
  hit the spot. (Online April 1, 2006)<br>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">I vanliga fall &auml;r &Ouml;resund Space Collective 
  ett g&auml;ng musikanter som st&auml;nger in sig i n&aring;gon replokal (Malm&ouml; 
  och K&ouml;penhamn tycks vara de mest frekventerade platserna) och bara jammar 
  timme ut och timme in. Galna jams som sedan hamnar p&aring; bandets hemsida 
  f&ouml;r de initierade fansen att ladda ner. Enligt uppgift ska det finnas &ouml;ver 
  tjugo timmars material att ta del av p&aring; sidan. Men det &auml;r inga hejdl&ouml;sa 
  jams det handlar om p&aring; den h&auml;r exklusiva skivan, utgiven enbart i 
  500 handnumrerade exemplar. Denna sj&auml;lvbetitlade skiva bjuder ist&auml;llet 
  p&aring; studioinspelningar av utvalt - och f&ouml;rmodligen representativt 
  - material. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Det skulle dock lika g&auml;rna ha kunnat vara jams. 
  Det ryms sju melodier p&aring; skivan och s&aring; gott som samtliga &auml;r 
  v&auml;ldigt utdragna och minst sagt flummiga. &Ouml;resund Space Collective 
  tycks ha en f&ouml;rk&auml;rlek f&ouml;r jazz och anv&auml;nder sig mycket av 
  s&aring;dana takter. Sedan draperar de det hela i en rymdlik rockskrud som tycks 
  sv&auml;va utanf&ouml;r gemene mans musikaliska sf&auml;rbegr&auml;nsningar. 
  Det &auml;r innovativt och ganska behagligt, men samtidigt lite v&auml;l flippat. 
  Det &auml;r l&auml;tt att dra drogparalleller till s&aring;dan h&auml;r musik. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Det blir lite l&aring;ngtr&aring;kigt att lyssna genom 
  hela skivan, det g&aring;r inte att sticka under stol med. Allt skulle n&auml;mligen 
  ha kunnat vara en och samma l&aring;t, skillnaden mellan sp&aring;ren &auml;r 
  inte s&auml;rskilt stor om vi s&auml;ger s&aring;. Men det tycks &auml;nd&aring; 
  som om &Ouml;resund Space Collective varit ute efter att skapa en k&auml;nsla, 
  snarare &auml;n att skriva l&aring;tar. Det &auml;r det d&auml;r medryckande 
  som finns i jamkonsten som &auml;r skivans styrka. Dessutom &auml;r jag ganska 
  svag f&ouml;r de Star Wars-minnande synthesizereffekter som ligger inbakade 
  i samtliga l&aring;tar. </font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Som bakgrundsmusik passar det h&auml;r sj&auml;lvbetitlade 
  verket utm&auml;rkt, men det k&ouml;r som sagt fast lite efter ett tag. Tror 
  d&auml;rf&ouml;r att jag skulle ha ganska sv&aring;rt f&ouml;r tokjammen man 
  kan ladda ner fr&aring;n hemsidan och n&ouml;jer mig d&auml;rf&ouml;r med den

  orgy. All the music is instrumental, ambient, trippy noodlings. Far better than 
  those NERD bands - like ISIS and PELICAN, some of who add horrible - grunts

  Die Musiker selbst bezeichnen das was sie tun als Mischung aus Funk, Jazz, Reggae 
  und &#132;Space Rock&#147;. Sicher kann man auch deutliche Elemente von Ambient-Musik 
  ausmachen. Denn &Ouml;SC l&auml;sst sich eigentlich kaum konzentriert h&ouml;ren, 
  sondern eher nebenher, um bei den experimentellen, oft synthielastigen St&uuml;cken 
  eine bestimmte, tr&auml;umerische Stimmung aufkommen zu lassen. Warum nur nebenher? 
  Weil &Ouml;SC ausschlie&szlig;lich Jam-Sessions auf CD gebrannt haben. Folglich 
  bewegen sich die meisten Songs innerhalb eines Akkords. Das ist f&uuml;r Leute 
  wie mich, die auf eing&auml;ngige Hooklines stehen, nat&uuml;rlich nicht der 
  Bringer schlechthin. Und auch viele unserer Leser werden fragen, was so eine 
  CD eigentlich hier bei Metalspheres zu suchen hat. Aber es gibt einen Aspekt, 
  der die Musik von &Ouml;SC f&uuml;r einen gr&ouml;&szlig;eren Kreis interessanter

  of the Swedish, Danish and American Musicians who together form the Oresund

  from the Danish bands Gas Giant &amp; Mantric Muse, or Swedes Bland Bladen. 
  Nope, I&#146;ve not heard of any of these. OSC&#146;s regular jam sessions (often 
  including guest musicians, from Carpet Knights and others) have already yielded 
  over 20 hours of spaced out jamming &#150; all of which is available as free 
  mp3&#146;s at their web site &#150; generous or what? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This year will also see the release of a series of Picks 
  From Space, available as CDR&#146;s (or FLAC Downloads) of some of the best 
  of the jam sessions, with enhanced sound quality. This CD however, is a fully 
  realised studio recording of their best material. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A track-by-track review would be somewhat redundant as, 
  essentially, you&#146;re going to go for this CD or not, depending on your feelings 
  about space rock and instrumental jam sessions. Fans of bands like Quarkspace 
  (their Spacefolds series is a very good indicator of the kind of stuff here), 
  Djam Karet, Hawkwind (of course) Gong, and perhaps Ozric Tentacles (without 
  so much ethnic or Reggae influences), should all find something to like here. 
  Ideally suited for late night trip-outs, there are some seriously mind-expanding 
  and cosmic Bliss-outs contained herein. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The emphasis is largely on ensemble playing, with smoothly 
  evolving themes ebbing and flowing across the course of the tracks, but there 
  is some nice soloing too, chiefly from guitar and synths. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">For highlights, check out the pulsating Fake It All The 
  Way with Floydian slide guitar embellishments, Consumed By The Goblin which 
  even evokes The Doors, with its haunting electric piano, or Grab A Cab with 
  its Ozric&#146;s styled reggae lilt and electronic burbling. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Needless to say, this is not for those who like structured 
  songs or vocals, and some may find its meandering style to be a little too laid 
  back, but it pleasantly blends in subtle hints of jazz and funk for variety 
  and, for the seasoned space-cadet, this should nicely fit the bill. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The rating is based on the likely appeal to a wider audience, 
  and space rockers can safely add at least another point on. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">There am one of those discs here that cost to even catalogue 
  and to understand if one is not a scholar in the style. This band integrated 
  by Danish, Swedish and North American musicians, makes debut in CD with this 
  album homónimo and in which they unfold a true arsenal of sounds and noises, 
  giving rise to a luck of improvisations of totally instrumental space-rock, 
  mixed with jazz, funk, reggae and diverse effects of sintetizadores. I am not 
  a great fanatic of this sort, but it is impossible to not know the competent 
  thing of the musicians involved in the band, that is to say: Magnus (guitar, 
  effects, sintetizadores), Sebastian (guitar, effects), Dave (under), Michael 
  (under), Scott (sintetizadores), Wave (sintetizadores), Mogens (sintetizadores), 
  and Soren (battery). To mention some reference, the first Pink Floyd and King 
  Crimson could be been worth, but nondefinitive, since of one or another form 
  the group fixes them to sound like no other. Totally minimalista and sectarian, 
  this album is, without doubts, a sample of the present time of this sort that 
  as much height had in 60's and 70's, and that bands as Oresund Space Collective 
  is in charge to maintain effective. I am sure that for that is not within the

  of "jams" are going to enjoy it much and. Web site: www.oresundspacecollective.com

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Inizialmente questi &Oslash;resund Space Collective mi 
  hanno dato l'impressione della classica band di new-freakettoni incapaci di 
  gestire un brano al di fuori dei soliti stereotipi, il primo ascolto di questo 
  cd mi stava gi&agrave; stimolando non pochi sbadigli... Con un pochino di pazienza 
  e dopo qualche attento ascolto mi sono accorto che, per quanto assai soporiferi, 
  gli &Oslash;resund Space Collective qualche buona sensazione riescono pure a 
  ricavarla dal torpore delle loro lunghe jam improvvisate! Questo collettivo 
  scandinavo &egrave; formato da ben otto musicisti, di cui almeno la met&agrave; 
  tastieristi o manipolatori di suoni, due chitarristi, due bassisti ed un batterista. 
  Le chitarre sembrano mantenere una posizione pi&ugrave; defilata del solito, 
  il suono di questo album &egrave; naturalmente affidato in gran parte ai sintetizzatori, 
  talvolta un gradevole organetto sembra voler riesumare polverose nostalgie dei 
  sixsties, con le chitarre a disegnare languidi e sonnolenti assoli, in sintonia 
  con il tono rilassato del disco. Inevitabilmente, buona parte dei clich&egrave; 
  del rock psichedelico vengono rispettati con una certa devozione. A tratti i 
  brani prendono una piega sottilmente jazzata, anche per l'utilizzo di un discreto 
  piano elettrico, ogni tanto si fa percepibile anche qualche deviazione verso 
  i percorsi musicali tracciati in passato dai corrieri cosmici tedeschi... La 
  variet&agrave; non fa dunque difetto agli &Oslash;resund Space Collective ed 
  i sette pezzi che compongono quest'album possono essere tutto fuorch&eacute; 
  sgradevoli... In questo lavoro manca forse una vera e propria sostanza che possa 
  dare un valore pienamente artistico a questo progetto, qualcosa che possa andare 
  al di l&agrave; del semplice sfondo musicale per le nostre attivit&agrave; preferite, 
  psichedeliche o meno che siano... Comunque, specialmente per i devoti appassionati 
  del cosmic-psych rock, gli &Oslash;resund Space Collective meritano almeno un 
  ascolto.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This hand-Numbered Run of 500 copies is the debut CD 
  of the Swedish, Danish and American Musicians who together form the Oresund 
  Space Collective, a free-improvising Space Rock group. Most of the members are 
  from the Danish bands Gas Giant &amp; Mantric Muse, or Swedes Bland Bladen. 
  Nope, I&#8217;ve not heard of any of these. OSC&#8217;s regular jam sessions 
  (often including guest musicians, from Carpet Knights and others) have already 
  yielded over 20 hours of spaced out jamming &#8211; all of which is available 
  as free mp3&#8217;s at their web site &#8211; generous or what? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">This year will also see the release of a series of Picks 
  From Space, available as CDR&#8217;s (or FLAC Downloads) of some of the best 
  of the jam sessions, with enhanced sound quality. This CD however, is a fully 
  realised studio recording of their best material. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A track-by-track review would be somewhat redundant as, 
  essentially, you&#8217;re going to go for this CD or not, depending on your 
  feelings about space rock and instrumental jam sessions. Fans of bands like 
  Quarkspace (their Spacefolds series is a very good indicator of the kind of 
  stuff here), Djam Karet, Hawkwind (of course) Gong, and perhaps Ozric Tentacles 
  (without so much ethnic or Reggae influences), should all find something to 
  like here. Ideally suited for late night trip-outs, there are some seriously 
  mind-expanding and cosmic Bliss-outs contained herein. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The emphasis is largely on ensemble playing, with smoothly 
  evolving themes ebbing and flowing across the course of the tracks, but there 
  is some nice soloing too, chiefly from guitar and synths. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">For highlights, check out the pulsating Fake It All The 
  Way with Floydian slide guitar embellishments, Consumed By The Goblin which 
  even evokes The Doors, with its haunting electric piano, or Grab A Cab with 
  its Ozric&#8217;s styled reggae lilt and electronic burbling. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Needless to say, this is not for those who like structured 
  songs or vocals, and some may find its meandering style to be a little too laid 
  back, but it pleasantly blends in subtle hints of jazz and funk for variety 
  and, for the seasoned space-cadet, this should nicely fit the bill. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The rating is based on the likely appeal to a wider audience, 
  and space rockers can safely add at least another point on. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Conclusion: 6.5 out of 10 </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Reliant la Norv&egrave;ge et la Su&egrave;de, le pont 
  d&#8217;&Oslash;resund jette aujourd&#8217;hui les bases d&#8217;une collaboration 
  internationale entre des musiciens des deux pays pr&eacute;cit&eacute;s et d&#8217;autres, 
  Am&eacute;ricains. Ce collectif de huit space-rockers, tous fort talentueux, 
  se rassemble pour jammer autour de th&egrave;mes plus ou moins d&eacute;finis 
  allant du space le plus classique (genre Hawkwind) en passant par du kraut, 
  du psych&eacute;d&eacute;lique et m&ecirc;me du reggae. Ce premier album officiel 
  reprend le meilleur de ces jams et&#8230; wouawwww ! Huit musiciens, dont de 
  nombreux multi-instrumentistes, cela laisse la place aux d&eacute;veloppements, 
  aux superpositions de couches, au remplissage touffu de l&#8217;espace sonore. 
  Autant dire qu&#8217;on ne s&#8217;ennuie pas une minute &agrave; l&#8217;&eacute;coute 
  de ce CD. <br>
  Faked it all the way peut sembler r&eacute;p&eacute;titive de prime abord, mais 
  de ces r&eacute;p&eacute;titions qui, &agrave; l&#8217;instar d&#8217;un Bolero 
  de Ravel, &eacute;voluent &agrave; chaque phrase, construisant doucement une 
  atmosph&egrave;re imparable. Consumed by the Goblin attaque en space rock majeur 
  et bourr&eacute; d&#8217;inventivit&eacute;. N&#8217;oublions pas qu&#8217;il 
  s&#8217;agit ici de jam sessions et que les pi&egrave;ces &eacute;voluent, changent 
  d&#8217;atmosph&egrave;re, se durcissent, s&#8217;adoucissent. Une attaque de 
  guitare peut trouver son parall&egrave;le dans une apparente simplification 
  rythmique qui cache en fait la pr&eacute;paration d&#8217;une d&eacute;ferlante 
  de batterie lourde et d&eacute;cha&icirc;n&eacute;e, et aussi l&#8217;inverse. 
  C&#8217;est le cas sur OSC Bolero et Falling Stardrops. Grab a cab poss&egrave;de 
  cette atmosph&egrave;re et cette construction qui rappelle furieusement Hawkwind, 
  tandis que Moonhead rappelle une douceur made in Ozric Tentacles. Pour finir, 
  Sundown nous offre un crescendo space rock du meilleur tonneau.<br>
  On peut regretter que le collectif n&#8217;apporte rien de nouveau sous les 
  astres spatiaux du genre, mais voici une &eacute;toile qui brille intens&eacute;ment. 
  Pourvu qu&#8217;elle ne soit pas trop &eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;re. Ah, oui 
  ! Pour ceux qui appr&eacute;cient, TOUTES les jams du collectif sont enregistr&eacute;es, 
  enti&egrave;rement t&eacute;l&eacute;chargeables sur leur site et tri&eacute;es 
  par affinit&eacute;. On ne peut qu&#8217;applaudir le travail de ces messieurs 
  et leur d&eacute;marche int&egrave;gre et totale. Bravo !</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>You may well be able to work out from the name what style of music these guys 
  play &#8211; yes, its space rock, with no vocals. The main core of the band 
  are guys from Mantric Muse, Gas Giant and Bland Bladen, but others may turn 
  up to join the improvised sessions that are at the heart of what these guys 
  are really about. They record all of their sessions with the aim of making the 
  music freely available through the web as mp3 downloads (so far you can download 
  20 hours of music from www.oresundspacecollective.com if you so desire).This 
  is a studio album, so am not sure if this has been taking from tapes of the 
  sessions, if they improvised live in the studio, or if they have re-recorded 
  something that they have previously developed. However it came about, this is 
  a limited edition release, and is actually very good if you like the genre. 
  It is music to play late at night looking at the stars, letting yourself just 
  drift into the universe of their creation. For more details visit www.recordheaven.net

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Review:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Oresund Space Collective is a international group comprised 
  of Danish, Swedish, American musicians that have come together to compose well 
  improvised modern space jams. The group had occasional members from Danish bands 
  Mantric Muse and Gas Giant and Swedish groups Carpet Knights and Sgt.Sunshine.<br>
  The band&#8217;s sound is very similar to Ozric Tentacles but with a bit more 
  flavor to the arrangements They combine trippy synthesizer loops, slow improvised 
  jams, almost reggae rhythms to put some of the most enjoyable instrumental music 
  I&#8217;ve heard in along while. Even though the music isl improvised it has 
  a well structured feel to it. The music has a relaxed feeling to it but enough 
  energy to it that keeps you wanting hear what they&#8217;ll do next. According 
  to the band's website, this is a limited edition run so get your copy as soon 
  as possible!</font></p>

<p>Oresund Space Collective &#8211; s/t. 2006. I can&#8217;t seem to get enough 
  of the Transubstans label, who are discovering new quality groups at an alarming 
  rate. Oresund Space Collective are yet another Scandinavian space rock crew, 
  who revel in the art of the groove and the jam, and eschew any kind of arty 
  pretension. Large ensembles are the way to go when performing this kind of exploratory 
  music, and OSC deliver all kinds of personnel and instrumentation. A true international 
  bunch, in that their very name is the bridge between Denmark and Sweden (plus 
  an American who has the good sense to live amongst the peaceful). This band 
  has already coughed up a followup double CD + a 3rd is on the way. I can hardly 
  wait.</p>

&Oslash;resund Space Collective </font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
<p>Un tuffo negli spazi siderali. &Egrave; questo ci&ograve; che vi aspetta non 
  appena il disco d&#8217;esordio del collettivo &Oslash;resund Space Collective 
  entrer&agrave; nel vostro lettore. Note cosmiche inizieranno a fluire indisturbate, 
  la vostra mente si aprir&agrave; su luoghi fantastici e incredibili, tra campi 
  magnetici e galassie sconfinate. Tutto ci&ograve; grazie a Magnus (chitarre, 
  synth), Sebastian (chitarra), Dave (basso), Michael (basso), Scott (synth), 
  Ola (fender rhodes, synth), Mogens (synth) e S?ren (batteria). Otto grandi musicisti 
  (danesi, svedesi e americani) che militano o hanno militano in gruppi del calibro 
  di Mantric Muse, Gas Giant, Pseudo Sun, Nadir, Derango, Kaabel e Bland Bladen 
  (e che occasionalmente sono affiancati da altri menestrelli interplanetari di 
  band come Sgt. Sunshine, Mother Superior, Black Hole e Carpet Knights).<br>
  L&#8217;ora abbondante di questo cd &egrave; frutto di una jam completamente 
  improvvisata e a quanto pare la band ha ancora ore e ore di materiale da pubblicare. 
  Per ora ci accontentiamo di questo album e godiamo in pieno delle divagazioni 
  che nel nome di Hawkwind, Tangerine Dream, Can, Gong, Ozric Tentacles e 35007 
  il collettivo elabora. &#8220;Faked it all the way&#8221; apre il rituale con 
  dei synth super spaziali degni del miglior Klaus Schulze, seguiti dalla cavalcata 
  psichedelica di &#8220;Consumed by the Goblin&#8221;, un dedalo di ritmiche 
  elettrizzanti, organo, sintetizzatori, chitarre liquide e un morbido piano fender. 
  Le atmosfere ariose di &#8220;OSC Bolero&#8221; (odore di spezie orientali e 
  umori provenienti da paesi lontani) preparano a &#8220;Falling stardrops&#8221;, 
  15 minuti di sublime psichedelia, in questo caso con vocals in loop che rendono 
  ancora pi&ugrave; straniante e visionario l&#8217;ascolto. &#8220;Grab a cab&#8221; 
  &egrave; un impasto lisergico di space rock, progressive e dub di chiara matrice 
  Ozric, &#8220;Moonhead&#8221; &egrave; un breve intermezzo che ci fa approdare 
  alla conclusiva &#8220;Sundown&#8221;, lunga astrazione ambient cosmo kraut 
  durante la quale si ha davvero la netta sensazione di perdere il senso del tempo.<br>
  D&#8217;altronde basta seguire il consiglio riportato nel booklet: this is a 
  headphone cd. Listen, relax, enjoy&#8230;</p>
