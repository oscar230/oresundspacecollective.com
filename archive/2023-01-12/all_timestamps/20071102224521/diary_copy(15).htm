<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF"> I picked up Tobias (Carpet Knights) from the &Oslash;restad 
  station at 19:30 and we got some beer and headed straight over to the rehearsal 
  room. Everyone was there but they were not set up yet. A british guy named Aston 
  brought his clarinet and french horn (did not play it into the microphone), 
  Kasper had conga's set up and Mikael Krog (Ex- Mantric Muse) was set up with 
  his guitar. I thought he was going to play keyboards so I was quite surprised. 
  So today, it was just me and mogens on synths and 3 guitar players and conga, 
  drums, bass and maybe clarinet... The usual supply of beers and joints and everyone 
  was ready to fly... This is the most funky we ever have been.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">The first jam, was a bit of chaos as we all tried 
  to find our sound and while you could hear the congas and clarinet when it was 
  low, these sounds were soon lost in the loud sound. Everyone was turned up later. 
  The soundcheck jam was like 27 minutes.. After a few adjustments (not quite 
  good enough), we jammed for another 51 minutes. Tobias played some very cool 
  guitar and started some cool riffs. I just love the sound he gets with this 
  digitech wammy pedal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">We had another 35 min jam and then Michael and Mikael 
  had to leave so magnus took over on bass and kasper played the drums and s&oslash;ren 
  the percussion. We tried to keep the level down a bit... It never really works 
  that well. We always buildup and get loud. Another 30 minutes and we took another 
  short break. I took my gear down but the others still wanted to play (but I 
  was not recording anymore) and they all switched around instruments and mogens 
  played bass, tobias played bass, magnus played drums or OSCar, Aston played 
  magnus's guitar, mogens played magnus's guitar and later Tobias's guitar. IT 
  was mostly just fucking around and not that cool but the end when Tobias played 
  this very repetitive CAN- Circle like bass line and Magnus wrapped around some 
  cool synth loops and mogens played some guitar and a friend of kaspers played 
  digeridoo (you could hardly hear it). This was cool and I wish I had recorded 
  this. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">A fun night as always and some good music... enjoy.......</font></p>
