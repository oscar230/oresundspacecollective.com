<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Oct 7th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Phew.... I am tired. For us and also you fans 
  of what we are doing, we just recorded 7 hrs of jams in the studio this weekend. 
  Check out the diary and the pictures on the Session 37 links. IT was a great 
  time and a fun to bring a nearly totally new band into the studio and see what 
  happens.. It was amazing to have KG from <a href="http://www.sienaroot.com">Siena 
  Root</a> come down from Stockholm to play guitar, hammond and sitar! We played 
  some great groovy jams and not as spaced out. I think once we sort through all 
  of it and it is mixed, we will have a couple hours of great stuff. This stuff 
  won't be released until April or May next year though. I will put some samples 
  up that I recorded from the recording room with my Edirol shortly so you can 
  hear some of the stuff.. Thanks again for buying the Black Tomato CD and if 
  you are interested in helping us release our music on vinyl, please get in contact. 
  Time to sleep......</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Sept 30th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Anyone like to see the &Oslash;resund Space 
  Collective on vinyl? I would but we just can't afford it. I am looking for some 
  people who might be interested in helping us to put our material out on vinyl. 
  I have the quotes for putting It's all about Delay out on as a 4LP set in a 
  glossy gatefold sleeve (2 records in each side) as well as releasing our debut 
  on a double vinyl. We will probably remaster It's all about Delay specically 
  for vinyl, if we raise the money. Please <a href="mailto:scott@oresundspacecollective.com">email 
  me</a> if you are interested. IT will probably take about 3-6 months before 
  you would get your money back. You will of course get free copies of the records. 
</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Sept 22nd</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Just a quick note to say that our debut CD 
  is officially sold out now. Transubstans and us do not have any more copies. 
  Thanks to all of those who bought one of the 500 hand numbered editions. You 
  own a rarity now. IF the CD is repressed it will not be in a hand numbered edition. 
  I hope that we can release this next on a double vinyl record though in 2008. 
  Just not sure there is the demand for it. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Sept 20th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Ok... the first videos of the OSC from Session 
  29 is now up at You Tube. Check it out from our sessions pages in session 29 
  or search Oresund Space Collective at You Tube.. .Also are some studio clips 
  from Session 27 (in the diary) and a few shots from my digital camera (Thanks 
  Rene) from Plauen, Germany, Enjoy. Some of this you will see again on our DVD 
  but in better quality and the concert stuff will be sync'd with our better audio 
  sources.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Sept 16th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I wanted to let everyone know that if you order 
  something from our shop, you will get your name in our next CD as a special 
  thanks for the support you give us. It is this money that allows this project 
  to go into the studio on a regular basis and keep putting out cool music. In 
  other news, we will not play at New Years Eve party but we have been invited 
  to Italy but I don't know when this will happen. I keep you posted. We also 
  hope to have Picks from Space Vol 11 and 12 finished soon. Vol 11 will be the 
  studio outtakes from our first, It's all about Delay and possibly the full length 
  13 minute version of Viking Cleaner. NOt sure yet. Vol 12 will include the best 
  of some of the recent rehearsal room sessions. We also have 12 tracks (110mins) 
  of stuff from the Black Tomato sessions that I am working with. Finally, I will 
  get some video up on You Tube by next friday...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>Sept 4th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The new CD is out! The first reviews are up 
  on the web page in the <a href="blacktomatoreviews.htm">Reviews link</a> on 
  the left side of the page. Come see what the critics think so far! I have also 
  added some reviews of the Picks from Space as well. I have updated the concerts 
  as well. We have some cool events coming up and maybe a NYE party!</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 25th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">CD release party was a blast despite few people. 
  A few samples are up and the pics and diary as well. Enjoy this very psychedelic 
  show. Show is being uploaded to <a href="http://www.archive.org">archive.org</a> 
  now!</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 22nd</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The CD is due to arrive on Friday morning just 
  in time for the party. Those who have pre-ordered the CD, it will be mailed 
  on friday or Saturday. I know you all will love this one. People who have ordered 
  stuff recently have probably noticed a postage charge being added now. The price 
  to mail things from Denmark has become so expensive, we had no choice but to 
  add a small charge. Really sorry...It is especially hard for you in the USA 
  as the dollar is so weak versus the British Pound at this time.. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">In other news, we are trying to set up a special 
  jam session with Causa Sui in November and a show with Damo Suuzki in late Jan 
  or early Feb. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">All the best<strong>... Scott and the OSC</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 10th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello... the artwork and CD master was turned 
  in last week and we are praying we will have the CDs on August 24th for the 
  CD release party. IT looks pretty good. Anyway, here is a peak at what the cover 
  of the CD will look like:</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><img src="IMAGES/black-tomato-m-titel-og-log.jpg" width="209" height="180"></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">If you go to the shop you can pre-order the 
  CD now. Thanks to all those who have to help us out. We might be playing in 
  Finland on Sept 15th at the Earthdance festival. Looks like we have a gig in 
  Trondheim on Dec 1st as well. Looking to get a gig in Hamar or Lillehammer on 
  Nov 30th. If you have any contacts, please write... Hope to see some of you 
  at Dragens Hule in 2 weeks...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>August 1st</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">In August, we will release our 3rd CD as a 
  deluxe digipack, limited to 1000 copies. It is will be released and distributed 
  via Transubstans Records as have all our releases. It features Rumble (38mins), 
  The Black Tomato (32mins) and Viking Cleaner (6 mins) for a total of 77 minutes. 
  I think you will find that these are some of our coolest journeys in sound&#8230;. 
  I know you will like them. The sound production is the best we have ever had 
  (and I thought our other CDs had amazing sound!). Thanks to Henrik Udd for the 
  amazing mix and Hans for the mastering job! </p>
<p align="center"> October 5-6th, the new line up of the &Oslash;resund Space 
  Collective will hit the studio to record the next CD. The guys who from Mantric 
  Muse are taking a break from playing (but not supporting and helping us), while 
  Stefan and Thomas from Gas Giant are stepping up to fly out into space with 
  us&#8230;. We will also have a special guest playing synthesizers on the session, 
  but you will have to wait to read about it in the diary! Sorry..</p>
<p align="center"> We have about 90mins of some really cool video from our last 
  Dragens Hule show in Feb and it is likely that Steen will video tape our next 
  show as well. I hope from this we can put together some sort of DVD by the end 
  of the year. You will have to wait a little longer, sorry..</p>
<p align="center"> As for live gigs&#8230; here is what is on the agenda at the 
  moment:</p>
<p align="center">August 24th CD release Party- Dragens Hule, Copenhagen<br>
  Sept- Jam Session<br>
  Oct 18th- Possible gig in Malmo, Sweden<br>
  Nov 29th- Alternative Maiden Club, Oslo<br>
  Nov 30th- Gig in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden or Trondheim, Norway<br>
  Dec 31st- OSC New Years Eve Party????? Just an idea right now..</p>
<p align="center"> It is possible that Ozric Tentacles will play in Denmark in 
  November and we might play with them. It is also possible that Acid Mothers 
  Temple will play and we will try to set up a gig together.. None of this is 
  confirmed now.. Just rumors of things that might or might not happen. </p>
<p align="center"> Finally, starting around August 5th, we will start to accept 
  pre-orders for the Black Tomato CD. We would be very grateful to those who pre-order 
  the CD, as this money will go into our pockets and help to finance our next 
  studio session, further mixing of more material, our hard disc recorder so we 
  can make multitrack recordings of all of our shows and jams, etc&#8230; I promise, 
  I have the envelopes ready and will mail them out as soon as I have them in 
  my hands! </p>
<p align="center"> Also, we have a new pressing of t-shirts in and we have XXL, 
  XL, L, M, S and XS due next week&#8230; Phew&#8230;. </p>
<p align="center"> I will also try to finish up Picks from Space Vol. 11 (It&#8217;s 
  all about Delay outtakes). We have a final mix of Jam 9 and 14, which we had 
  no space on the double CD for. Our last jam of the night, 22, was also quite 
  cool but a bit rough in the middle and it might be included as well. We also 
  might add the full length Tony Blair witch crocket project, as this was edited 
  down to 15 minutes on the CD but runs a full 25 minutes and the last few minutes 
  is really cool&#8230;</p>
<p align="center"> Finally, it looks like Steve Hayes (Hawkwind, Secret Saucer, 
  etc..) will doing some mixing of the material left over from our last studio 
  session that Henrik Udd did not have time to mix&#8230; This is not certain 
  yet but there is another 60-70mins of some really excellent material.. shorter 
  jams&#8230;</p>
<p align="center"> Thanks again to all of you who have and continue to support 
  us. The Spaceship OSC could never fly and make it without the support you all 
  put into us&#8230; Thanks once again and I hope we can soon unleash a lot more 
  cool spaced out jam music for some great adventures to the other side&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

  so if you want XXL, XL, S or XS, we should have these in 3 weeks. Starting around 
  august 1st we will begin to take preorders in the shop for the new CD, the Black 
  Tomato. We are finishing up the artwork now and the CD will be mastered this 
  weekend. Those who preorder it will have it mailed out as soon as I have it 
  in my hands from the CD factory. Our show in Malm&ouml; next weekend is cancelled 
  but we wil still have the CD release party on August 24th. It will be a special 
  show.. We hope to have a jam session in September and you can see we have booked 
  the studio in October to record our next CD. Hope you are all having a great

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We had a really great time in Germany and really 
  want to thank Gerd, Beate and all the people from the <a href="http://www.Germanheads.de">German 
  Grateful Dead Heads</a> for such a wonderful weekend of music. The venue, music 
  and the people were all amazing... Thank you so much.. We really hope that we 
  will be able to play for you again. Also, a big thanks to our friend <a href="Http://www.sulatron.com">Dave</a>, 
  who played with us. IT was so awesome.. The diaries are up and some photos as 
  well. IF you have any good photos from the gig, please send them to me. Some 
  audio from all the sets is up as well. Great sound but almost no synthesizers. 
  Sorry.. Look for it on archive.org in the next 2 days. I am starting to upload 
  soon. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We are heading down to the <a href="http://www.germanhead.sde">Playing 
  in the Band Festival IX</a> later today to perform 2 concerts in Plauen, Germany. 
  IT should be a really great time and we are so happy to be able to play for 
  some of our German fans! We have just made a deal in Hungary and our music will 
  shortly be available via the web at a place called <a href="http://www.dalok.hu">Dalok.hu</a>. 
  Our next CD, The Black Tomato will soon be mastered up in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden 
  and we hope to have it out in late August. More on this soon. I will let you 
  know when the diary, pics and music are up. Thanks again to those who have donated 
  some money for the free MP3 files.. Oh yeah.. every Monday night you can hear 
  a great space-psychedelic rock radio show now in streaming audio. Check it out.

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>May 4th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Last night we had our 33rd session and the 
  first with a new drummer named PIB. It was pretty damn cool. Half of this line 
  up is what will go and play the gigs in Plauen in 2 weeks. We are really looking 
  forward to coming to Germany. IT is still not certain that Dr. Space will go 
  but hopefully. Anyway, enjoy the whole short session. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>April 13th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Last night we played the last show of our small 
  tour to a small but enthusastic crowd. IT had quite a different flavor from 
  the other shows as we had a different drummer, bass player and a one different 
  guitarist. It is our shortest show ever at only 57 minutes but you can hear 
  and download the whole thing <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2007-04-12.aud.flac16">here</a>. 
  Lots of cool pictures on the web site as well. Thanks to all those who came 
  out. <a href="http://www.sienaroot.com">Siena Root</a> put on an amazing show. 
  Wow.. what a killer band. Don't miss them at Roadburn if you are going or on 
  the rest of their Europe tour. I hope that perhaps next year we get a chance 
  to space you all out at Roadburn. Magnus and I from the OSC will be in Holland. 
  Say hello! </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>April 10th</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">We are back to Denmark and have one more gig 
  on our first small tour ever. It was been a great time and a good success. Thanks 
  to all the great people in Siena Root for saving the day and taking such great 
  care of us in Stockholm. Also, thanks to Santtu and Hidria Spacefolk for the 
  amazing night in Helsinki! Finally, a speciak thanks to all of those who made 
  the effort to come out and support us and listen and buy merchandise at our 
  gigs. We really appreciate it. Great to meet you Rob (who flew all the way from 
  England for the gig), I look forward to us meeting again. If you took any great 
  pictures, please send them to us for the web site! THe diary and some music 
  samples are up now and a few pictures as well. I have also updated the reviews 
  section, biography, added a small page on the mixing of the new CD, etc.. and 
  should let you know that there is a great interview and article on us in the 
  new issue of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/badacidmagazine">Bad Acid</a>. 
  IT is an amazing magazine covering all kinds of non-mainstream space, psych, 
  doom, stoner and experimental music. Comes with a DVD loaded with video and 
  MP3 files. Check it out!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><font color="#990000" size="5">Urgent!!</font> 
  We have had a venue change for the Stockholm gig after the fucking promoter 
  cancelled the show yesterday. We will now play at a place called <font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hemliga 
  Tr&auml;dg&aring;rden</font>. We will play with only Siena Root and we will 
  play last and jam like hell. The address is: Johannesbergssgatan 6 i midsommerkkransen.

  the last minute change. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><strong>April 1st, 2007</strong></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">The OSC is about to go out on our first small 
  tour playing in Stockholm, Helsinki and Copenhagen all in one week! We hope 
  that we get to meet with many of those whom we have corresponded with. Please 
  come out and support us. We look forward to playing with Siena Root at two of 
  the gigs and also our good friends, Hidria Spacefolk! Please bring your recording 
  gear, video cameras, and cameras and document our gig. If you get a some good 
  pics, video or recordings, please send them to us. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Also, the OSC is looking to find someone in 
  southern Sweden or the Copenhagen area who would like to work with us on developing 
  an elaborate visual show. If you are into visual arts, projections, movies and 
  want a platform to experiment, please contact us. Also, we are in real need 
  of a full time sound person for our gigs. We can not offer any money at this 
  time but as we grow, we plan to include this in our expenses. </p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">See you on the road next week!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><b>March 26th</b></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Ok....OSC fans.. be prepared to get blasted! 
  Magnus and myself spend 2 long days with mix master UDD in G&ouml;teborg this 
  weekend and walked away with 3 massive mind blowing tracks. The sound is huge 
  and psychedelic. I think you guys are all going to like it. We still have to 
  finish the drum sound and do the mastering and final edits so it can fit onto 
  a 80 min CD, so it will still be a bit before you can all aurally taste the 
  BLACK TOMATO... Be patient and in the meantime, please try to come out and support 
  us on our 3 concerts in April.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Our fans are the best and this music is always 
  for you!</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Scott and the OSC</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><b>March 10th</b></p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Magnus and I will go up to G&ouml;teborg on 
  March 23-24th to do the final mixing on our new CD with Henrik Udd. The new 
  OSC CD will be called Black Tomato. It will feature only 3 tracks (Black Tomato, 
  Rumble, Viking Cleaner). We are thinking about postponing the release beyond 
  May but we are not sure yet. There will be some major changes in the OSC line 
  up after the April concerts, which will be the last with the core of what has 
  been OSC since nearly the beginning but no worries. We still have killer players 
  (Tobias, Jocke, Mogens, Stefan, Thomas, Luz, Kaufmann (if his back is well) 
  to keep the OSC freak flag flying..Some people just need a break from playing 
  this intense music to recharge their creative juices.. all have promised to 
  come back...</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">There is now a web site up for the <a href="http://www.germanheads.de">Playing 
  in the Band Festival IX</a> in Plauen. We will play for 2hrs on the friday night 
  and 1&frac12; hrs on the saturday night. I should also say that if you want 
  our first CD in the hand numbered edition, you should order now, as we have 
  only 10 copies left and the record company has about the same. </p>

  did not put the right file extension on the files.I thought that I had fixed 
  it but I have not. It won't generate the MP3 files of the little players. I 
  have taken the show down and it goes up again now and I hope it will be uploaded 
  by tomorrow morning (Copenhagen time). We will see. In the meantime, I will 
  put the rest of the show up as MP3's on our site so you can hear it. Sorry guys... 
  Also, we might have another concert confirmed shortly.</p>

  (first 2 sets) and some of it was filmed. The projections were really cool and 
  everyone seem to have a good time. Warning.. very psychedelic concert.. Wow.. 
  Samples from the 1st and 2nd set are up on our site and the concert is being

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">I hope you all are enjoying the high download 
  speeds we now have. Thanks Tobias! Looks like we are pretty close to have the 
  gig set up in Stockholm now. Please come out and support us for our winter party 
  at Dragens Hule on next friday, Feb. 9th. It is going to be amazing. We will 
  have a lot of guest musicians from Drahk von Trip and Gas Giant. 3 guitars, 
  3 synths, violin, bass, drums, percussion.. Monster space orchestra! We will 
  record everything so those who can't be there in person can hear it. At least 
  one set will be video taped as well.</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Good and bad news.. First the good. We will 
  play at <a href="http://www.studenterhuset.com/site/index.php">Studenterhuset</a> 
  in Copenhagen on Thursday, April 12th with <a href="http://www.sienaroot.com">Siena 
  Root</a>! This will sort of complete a mini- Scandinavian tour with Stockholm 
  (we hope), Helsinki and Copenhagen all in the same week! The bad news is that 
  the bastards at the Danish Post have raised the prices for mailing packages. 
  What used to cost 29kr now costs 45! That is outragreous, but I have had to 
  add postage costs to the shop now. We just can't absorb that kind of 30% increase. 
  Sorry folks.. We still try to sell things as cheap as we can.. </p>

  Keep on listening... and donating occasionally...</p>

  CDs by some good friends of ours. We have some copies of <a href="http://www.hidriaspacefolk.st">Hidria 
  Spacefolk</a>- Balansia, 3 CDs by <a href="http://www.korai.hu">Korai &Ouml;r&ouml;m</a> 
  as well as the Copenhagen Space Rock Festival Compilation CD. I also added a 
  couple of great new reviews of &quot;Its all abour Delay&quot;. I was searching 
  the web and can see a lot of web radio shows are playing tracks from the CD, 
  which is really great. Remember to check the web site on Saturday to hear and 
  download some tracks from our jam tomorrow! Thanks for those who are donating 
  to help us out to by a hard disc recorder to make multitrack recordings of all 
  the sessions!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Wow.. the good and the bad all happening at 
  the same time. First the good news. We will play our first gig ever in Finland 
  on Sunday April 8th at <a href="http://www.tavastiaklubi.fi/semifinal.php?lang=en">Semifinal</a> 
  in Helsinki with our great friends, <a href="http://www.hidriaspacefolk.st">Hidria 
  Spacefolk</a>! This is going to be an amazing night. They have a new CD out 
  next month as well. We will probably also have a winter party in Copenhagen 
  on Feb 9th or 10th and we are working on a gig in Malm&ouml; in March. We will 
  have our first jam session of the year next friday in Malmo and my good friend 
  and amazing guitarist from Gas Giant, who I played with some years back, will 
  finally join us. Watch out for some wicked space jamming! Look for some different 
  names in the jam session lists as some members will take a little break and 
  we will bring in some fresh blood. As for the bad news, I am pretty down about 
  my cousin, Cliff Heller, who died in a skydiving accident on Dec. 30th. We are 
  really good friennds and shared a lot of great concert experiences together 
  (Ozrics, Hawkwind, Eat Static, Funkadelic all in NYC) and everywhere I lived 
  in the world, he always came to visit and do things. I will miss him a lot. 
  Have a good weekend.</p>
<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Also, we just were picked as CD of the month 
  at Acid Dragon in the UK. Also some more fantastic reviews have come out that 
  I will add to the page this weekend. Finally, we will have a winter party at 
  the Dragens Hule. Just us and some cosmic projections for 3hrs of space rock.. 
  Please come out and support us!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Well, we did not win any awards at the Italian 
  Prog Awards but it was still nice to be recognized. I have added a lot more 
  pictures from the CD release party (Session 26). Thanks to Sonja and Anders 
  for providing the new pictures. I have also almost completed the artwork for 
  the soundboard recording of the Release party that we will see via the shop. 
  A very good quality soundboard and a nice performance from us. Check in a few 
  days. Our CD is now available from <a href="http://www.aural-innovations.com/store/">Aural 
  Innovations</a> in the USA now. The promo CDs are being sent out this week to 
  all the radio, magazines and more distributors. Look for more reviews soon. 
  Let's hope that people like it as much as the first reviews. We may have a concert 
  on Jan 25th but this is up in the air right now and we are working on confirming 
  a show in Helsinki on Saturday April 7th with Hidria Spacefolk! That will be 
  a monster space rock night for sure!</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Wow... that is all I can say... We had an amazing 
  weekend in the studio with Lars and Henrik and recorded over 6&frac12;hrs of 
  material. Read the diary and check out the pictures. I will work on making them 
  smaller. They look great but they are too big and load slowly now. Sorry... 
  I recorded some stuff inside the recording room with my Edirol and will give 
  you all a taste of 2 or 3 jams... Also, we shot about an hour of video in the 
  studio, which will appear at some point. The concert from last thursday is up 
  at the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OSC2006-11-09">archive.org</a>

  We are so happy that we lived up to and hopefully exceeded what you had expected

  our next studio CD. We will record at the Black Tornado Studios again with Lars 
  Lundholm, as well as having Henrik Udd assisting and doing the mixing of our

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Thanks to all our Swedish friends who came 
  out and helped us out with the party in Malm&ouml; on Friday. It was a bit of 
  a downer that so few people (30 or so) showed up and almost no one was into 
  the music. We have the coolest light show and stuff going on but no people. 
  It was a totally dead vibe. Anyway, please check out the music. It was a bitch 
  to EQ and get a decent sound and a damn dog fucked up the recording on the 2nd 
  set (See diary for more details). Sound is the best I could manage in this concrete 
  room with no people or anything to absorb the sound. Some nice pics of the evening 
  by Kaufmann are up on the web.. See you on NOv 9th, for a real party, this time...</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1">Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I just wanted to let people know that the Oresund Space Collective are half 
  way finished with mixing our next double CD called &quot;It's all about Delay&quot; 
  with cover artwork by Ed Unitsky. It is sounding great with tracks ranging from 
  5 minutes to 25 minutes, with most around 10 minutes long. The new CD is really 
  different from our first one and a lot more upbeat and diverse in the sounds. 
  I think our fans will for sure like this one a lot.</p>
<p> We have just sent off a track called Waaaaaah for the <a href="http://www.musicstreetjournal.com">Music 
  Street Journal Compilation</a> CD that will be out later this year with artists, 
  Erik Norlander, Lana Lane, Don Schiff and Gak Omak and the OSC. I am not sure 
  when it is coming out. </p>
<p> I have also completed compiling the latest 3 volumes in our best of jam session 
  CD-R series called Picks from Space. Volumes 8-10 should be ready in end of 
  next week. I am just working on the last of the artwork. We will have a good 
  price deal for those who buy all 3 at once. </p>
<p> We will play our only concert this summer on the weekend of July 21-22nd at 
  our usual place, the Dragens Hule. We hope to be joined by the amazing First 
  Band From Outer Space, who have a killer new CD out very soon. We will make 
  a monster jam session out of it as well. </p>
<p> Thanks for the support and keep downloading. Scott and the OSC</p>

  that Magnus has done of our new material and it sounds really really cool. I 
  think everyone out there is really going to love this new record. THere are 
  so many cool elements and you can hear it over and over still discover new things 
  in the music each time. The Ed Unitsky artwork is also amazing.. I keep you

  Planetscapes</a>, Doug Walker, has died of a heart attack this week. I was just 
  working with him on an <a href="http://www.alienplanetscapes.com">Alien Planetscapes 
  web page</a>. I am pretty devastated but one must move forward. Doug was very 
  encouraging and liked the stuff that the OSC was doing a lot. IT is a pity we 
  will never get to jam together but when we jam this saturday, it will be with 
  Doug in mind. Our next CD, which we are mixing right now is dedicated to his 
  memory..</p>

<p align="center" class="unnamed1"><font size="3">Well, I think all the OSC fans 
  out there are going to be blown away by the music we made this weekend! We recorded 
  6 hrs and 53 minutes of jams to 24 channels. The tape was running so to speak 
  when nothing was happening sometimes, so in the end we probably only have about 
  6 hrs or so of jams, only. The sound is totally amazing and have the PA set 
  up in the recording room worked so much better for most everyone and we really 
  played some killer hypnotic grooves and the sound is mind blowing... We have 
  enough material to make at least a double CD, perhaps more.. We will spend the 
  next few weeks digesting this stuff and trying to figure out what pieces we 
  should spend the time to mix properly. We will keep you posted and probably 
  put up a few teasers for you as well.. Another CD review has just been posted 
  on the web so check it out at<a href="http://melosprogbazaar.com/close_to_the_edge/">

  the jams. We will keep them coming. I now have the multi track discs and will 
  try to put up some more from this session. Unfortunately, the files were all 
  accidently deleted so this is the only mix we will ever get and some stuff was 
  lost for good as it was never burned down onto CD. Oh well, such is life...

    was a tough day but it was worth it. We recorded on 24 tracks 2&frac12; hours 
    of material in 4 jams. <br>
    An appropriate title for the session might be Space Crusing... We were crusing 
    a lot and not flying much but the sound <br>
    and the feel and most importantly, the textures we created were amazing. Very 
    spacey. </font></p>

    are sad to announce that Ola had an accident on Midsummers Night and injured 
    his thumb. <br>
    Please wish him a quick recovery! This will probably make it difficult for 
    him to play the Fender Rhoades <br>
    at our recording session but we will see. We are very psyched for recording 
    our first CD next weekend. Look out for the <br>
    diary soon after and pictures of how it went.</font></p>
