<p><strong><font size="4">Session 60- Psychedelic Network Festival, W&uuml;rzburg, 
  Germany 11/28/09</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="4">11/27/09</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="3">6:30am </font></p>
<p><font size="3">I am on the train to the airport and will catch the train to 
  Malm&ouml; to go pick up the van.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">6:45 Just missed the train so I have to wait until 6:56. The 
  van is suppose to be ready at 7:30 so this is ok timing anyway. Mathias arrived 
  in Malm&ouml; on time and is just having some breakfast at the station and will 
  meet me when I get the van. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">8:55 We are waiting for Nick to finish his cig and then we are 
  off to catch the ferry from Gedser (Denmark) to Rostock (Germany). We should 
  have plenty of time if all goes well. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">10:45 IT was a bit of a drama and I was in doubt if we would 
  make it or not due to a tractor and some trucks that were really slowling things 
  down on this one lane road into Gedser. We still have like 24km to go at 10:30 
  but we made it no problem.. </font></p>
<p><font size="3">12:05 Mathias, Mogens and I just had some food on the ferry. 
  NOt very good food. Mathias and Mogens are pretty strick vegetarians so a place 
  like this has little to offer besides french fries.. We have been talking about 
  music, synths, etc.. Mogens and NIck had a car race..</font></p>

<p><font size="3">16:05 We have arruved in Berlin at Walt's place. I could not 
  remember his last name so we had to go to the net cafe across the street so 
  I could look at my email so we could find it as there were like 20 poeple on 
  the mail box at his address. We are just hanging out and having some tea..</font></p>
<p><font size="3">23:45 We just had a great evening. We went out to Schneider 
  Burro, a mind blowing synthesizer place and mogens bought a Cjweman module and 
  some other stuff. I got a Doepher 2 layer case to start building my own modular 
  synth. We could have spent days at this place. Then we met up with my friend 
  Silvana and we all went to eat Indian food, which was not that good but the 
  company was... </font></p>
<p><font size="3"><img src="../Jam%20Pics/Session%2060/synth-heaven.jpg" width="614" height="460">. 
  Just some of the modular synth suff...</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>Day 2</strong></font></p>
<p>9:12 I just got out of the shower and Mathias he already had one but everyone 
  else is asleep. Mogens snores very loud and this kept me up some of the night. 
  I think I slept like 6 hrs though, which is pretty good for me on these trips. 
  I had some juice and a granola bar and am getting ready to log onto ticketmaste.nl 
  to try to get tickets for<a href="http://www.roadburn.com"> Roadburn</a>, which 
  go on sale at 10:00. OSC is playing which is amazing but I need to try to get 
  tickets for the Afterburner and also for some Danish friends if I can. I had 
  to make a deal with my daughter as her birthday is during Roadburn and I will 
  miss it, which really sucks for both of us. </p>
<p>10:50. Shit.. Roadburn sold out in 29 minutes. I got in several times to be 
  allowed to by tickets but my netbank verification failed and when I got in the 
  2nd time it said that I had already bought the limit of tickets so I ended up 
  with nothing! Fuck... </p>
<p>11:20 We are now at the van waiting for Walt and Christina who will drive first. 
  I hope everyone got tickets. I got an SMS from Nils and he got two. </p>
<p>14:00 We are about 200km away and making good time. We are having a pit stop 
  and getting some food and red bull and stuff. </p>

  Soundcheck</p>
<p>00:35 I am pretty blown away now. We played a really great concert and the 
  crowd was amazing. The light show mindblowing as well. Ax Gengrich was great, 
  Seven that spells were great and very loud! I sold bascially all the cds that 
  I brought. We no longer have anymore Its all about Delay or Black Tomato cds. 
  Anyway, the band was amazing. Walt and Dave were great and Mathias played totally 
  amazing guitar. He is one of the best we have ever played with. I was for sure 
  not as good as at our last concert. I had some monitor trouble, which was problematic. 
  Oh well. Fantastic audience! </p>
