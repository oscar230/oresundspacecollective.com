<p><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">This was the last jam session of 
  an amazing year. We had invited everyone who had played with the OSC in the 
  last year to join for the band &quot;Julefrokost&quot;. IT looked to be a big 
  party with 14 confirmed people, but in the end, only the real dedicated OSC 
  folks showed up. This was quite unfortunate as Mogens had spent a lot of money 
  and time to make all this awesome food and in the end, 6 people did not show 
  up who had said that they would. Anyway, their were 8 of us and we had an awesome 
  time. We all connect so well on a personal and musical level that it is always 
  a pleasure to be with my friends.... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"> I arrived at about 2:45 with Sebastian 
  and Ola, who I picked up at the train station and I hung out and then about 
  3:30. Magnus and I then went over to loan to amps for Sebastian and maybe Eduardo. 
  He never showed. We came back and set up most all the gear and then sat down 
  for a great fest of all vegitarian specialties. Potatoes, bread, fennel salad, 
  pasta salad with pesto, spinach and feta pies, r&oslash;dk&oslash;ol, nut and 
  lentil pate, and more... We made some toasts and had some schnapps and drank 
  the 5L Grolsch Beer keg that I brought. Coffee, joints and people were ready 
  to jam. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The first jam was just magnus, 
  sebastian, michael and s&oslash;ren as the mixer was not set up yet for all 
  us synth freaks. Kasper he joined us on Congas and also a real drum set. They 
  had a short jam which was quite cool, then we took off into space. IT was a 
  great night. We recorded 3 discs (58min, 70min and 79min ) of music with some 
  amazing grooves... Wait til you hear them..... Everyone was totally on this 
  night. The guitars are too low in the mix, sorry.... We have to figure this 
  out.... We need to record multitrack....</font></p>
