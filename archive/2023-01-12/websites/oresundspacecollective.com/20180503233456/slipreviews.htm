<p><strong>&Oslash;resud Space Collective : Slip into the vortex (Transubstans 
  060).</strong><br>
  <br>
  I have been privileged to listen to the next &Oslash;resund Space Collective 
  release, who will be available to the public sometime in april 2010. The former 
  releases by the fantastic &Oslash;SC, have been completely improvised in the 
  studio and have all been excellent in this reviewers book. This time the guys 
  from &Oslash;SC have teamed up with some new people playing saxophone, drums 
  and bass giving them a more mature and complete sound, going a little away from 
  the jammy sound that they have presented on their previous releases. Their earlier 
  releases have been in the space rock category with obvious inspiration from 
  the finnish masters of spacerock Hidria Spacefolk and the spacy releases from 
  Gong. On this their newest release they are going in new directions towards 
  a more progressive sound, which in my humble opinion is absolutelly excellent 
  and a really really good way to go. If you decide to get your hands on &quot;Slip 
  into the vortex&quot; (which i only can recommend that you do), you will be 
  presented for 6 tracks with some new ideas and directions in the music, but 
  still being true to their earlier releases and sound. My favourite track on 
  the cd is the nearly 26 minutes long &quot;Mothership machinery&quot; which 
  is a number that evolves and grows on you complete with slide guitar and saxophone 
  - amazing. As you probably all ready have guessed i think this release is very 
  good one and it should have its place in every progressive music fans collection, 
  or every other music collection for that matter. I am looking very much forward 
  to the next releases and the future of this amazing band. Take a trip into space 
  with &Oslash;resund Space Collective - you will not be disappointed !!! </p>

<p>&Oslash;resund Space Collective: Slip into the Vortex <br>
  Transubstans Records (Transubstans 060)</p>
<p> Transubstans offers us a new CD by Danish-Swedish psychedelic space-improvisation 
  group &Oslash;resund Space Collective. I think that the Psychotropic Zone readers 
  or those who have visited our club don&#8217;t need more specific introduction 
  to this band. The seventh official OSC release was recorded at Black Tornado 
  Studios in 2008 at the same sessions that earlier this year gave birth to the 
  collective&#8217;s amazing, first vinyl album Dead Man in Space (that is almost 
  sold-out everywhere so hurry up if you still need it for your collection!). 
  During those sessions the loose line-up featured also The Univerzals saxophone 
  player and also one of the two bass players (both from Carpet Knights) was new 
  while Bland Bladen&#8217;s Anders G. has played drums on many early OSC jam 
  sessions. You couldn&#8217;t really guess from the totally improvisation-based 
  music that they are in the studio with the band for the first time since the 
  playing is so fluent and flowing for most of the time. On guitars we&#8217;ve 
  got the seasoned member Magnus (Mantric Muse) as well as another old friend 
  Stefan (ex-Gas Giant, Sumo Sun) and on synthesizers and keyboards the only steady 
  OSC members Dr. Space and Mogens.</p>
<p>This album includes six tracks varying in length from six plus minutes to almost 
  25. First we have the ten-minute-long, a bit funky &#8221;I Teleported to Acapulco&#8221; 
  that is wacky, strange and groovy going. The band still sort of hold back the 
  tension in this one. Then comes the album&#8217;s longest track &#8221;Mothership 
  Machinery&#8221; that at first combines the pleasantly jazzy going with for 
  example slide guitar. Before the eight-minute-marker the jam gets heavier and 
  the Ozric Tentacles styled rhythmical synthesizer patterns give it a nice form 
  while the great space sounds lift the listener to heights. Towards the end the 
  atmosphere gets a bit looser again and the saxophone gets more room. Sax is 
  perfect for the band&#8217;s music, by the way! &#8221;Fondle the Frequency&#8221; 
  is a quite softly spacey and percussive number that also has some jazzy mood. 
  The album&#8217;s best track in my opinion is the over 18-minute-long &#8221;Slip 
  into the Vortex&#8221; where after the more peaceful, psychedelic atmospheres 
  the band finally gets to real tight, fast and hard space rocking. By now, if 
  not earlier, the synapses start to pop and pulsars throb&#8230; This is really 
  wild going where the guitarists truly freak out! This is the kind of stuff that 
  you&#8217;d like tp hear more during the OSC live gigs as well. &#8220;Sonic 
  Snake&#8221; is a nicely swinging improvisation in &frac34; beat and has some 
  great solo guitar among other things. A very pleasant piece. The CD is finished 
  with its shortest track &#8221;Lord of Slumber&#8221; that is a slow, pretty 
  melancholic piece and its chord changes bring to mind Hawkwind&#8217;s &#8220;Golden 
  Void&#8221;. This one has an amazing atmosphere and it is a great ending for 
  this really good album that is also available as a download.</p>

  &Oslash;resund Space Collective<br>
  Slip Into the Vortex (2010)<br>
  03|08|2010 [23:33:45] Florent Simon This collective of Copenhagen native professional 
  musicians regularly checks into the studio to give birth to totally improvised 
  musical textures, which enables them to publish post-production free albums 
  within a remarkably short amount of time. For this seventh album, recipe hasn't 
  changed a bit: a twenty-four minutes six track record of delicious psychedelic 
  scent, tripping progressive musics with an after taste of Pink Floyd or Ozric 
  Tentacles. Without any doubt, these too must hold Gong's monumental You as a 
  bible.</p>
<p>A risky stylistic exercise that yet remains enticing to anyone who knows other 
  albums of this gifted group and a model in musical art. Without any support, 
  eight musicians (coming from different backgrounds: Gas Giant, Sumo Sun ... 
  and among which two basses) try to tell an improvised story with as much spontaneity 
  and mastery as possible, taking the listener by the hand for a trip to the unkown, 
  as they don't know the destination themselves. From a musical point of view, 
  the Danes are much generous, their stage performances usually exceed three hours 
  (as a reminder: dozens of hours of concerts are available on their website, 
  sorted by genre).</p>
<p>Despite the risk of repetition, disorganization and lack of structure, &Oslash;resund 
  Space Collective handles it wonderfully and prove the true talent of those musicians, 
  who manage to captivate through well groomed easthetic sounding and advantaging 
  production. The musical content is rich and dense, sound is full of effects, 
  and in spite of a sometimes monotonous rhythm, the atmosphere feels renewed 
  with each track. One will go against the a priori idea bore by improvisation 
  music and will immerse oneself into the throbbing hypnotic rhythms of those 
  tracks, avoiding the pitfall of &quot;an introduction theme stretched to its 
  extreme point without ever taking off&quot;. </p>

  Space Collective: Slip Into the Vortex</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>18 months or so ago, I wasn't too kind to &Oslash;resund Space Collective's 
  Good Planets Are Hard to Find, an album in which, I felt, their totally improvised, 
  instrumental brand of space-rock jams failed to come off, unable to transport 
  the listener into that trance state that this sort of music often induces. </p>
<p>Slip Into the Vortex is a much more successful album, with some excellent instrumental 
  space-rock trance jam music.</p>
<p>On Good Planets Are Hard to Find, one of the key &quot;imported&quot; sounds 
  was the sitar of Siena Root's K G West: its integration into the music could 
  have been more successful. On Slip Into the Vortex, spacey keyboardists Mogens 
  and Dr.Space are again joined by guests from other bands: Stefan (Gas Giant 
  and Sumo Sun) and Magnus (Mantric Muse and Sumo Sun) on guitars, Anders G. (Bland 
  Bladen) on drums, Jocke and P&auml;r (Carpet Knights) on bass; and finally, 
  but definitely not least, Anders H (Univerzals) on saxophones. Anders H's playing 
  fits well into this space-rock jam style and the sax is a highlight of these 
  jams, even when played at the edge of its capabilities. The other major contributor 
  to the success of Slip Into the Vortex is the rhythmic playing. Anders G's drumming 
  is impressive here, inspiring rhythmic delights that carry this music through 
  its slow sections, lulling you into that trance before the pace quickens and 
  you sink deeper: it's certainly a very aptly named album!</p>
<p>Even a piece like &quot;Mothership Machinery&quot;, which comes in at some 
  25 minutes, succeeds through a variety of pace and intensity control, guitar 
  adding plenty of verve when it's needed.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem I have is the difference between my two reviews of these 
  two recent albums by the band: either Slip Into the Vortex really is more successful 
  as a jam space-rock experience than Good Planets Are Hard to Find, or my subjectivity 
  is showing through. I cannot be the judge to decide which. All I'll say in my 
  defence is that I give each and every album for review a number of &quot;blind&quot; 
  listens and decide its qualities on that basis before reading any promo notes, 
  relistening to/reviewing past material etc. Slip Into the Vortex works because 
  the players brought in for the jam have added verve, sonic textures and rhythm 
  that suit this form of mantric music.</p>
<p>Over to you...</p>

  From Progarchives.com, the ultimate progressive rock music website Windhawk 
  <br>
  Special Collaborator<br>
  Honorary Collaborator Multinational ensemble ORESUND SPACE COLLECTIVE has been 
  an active unit since starting up some time after the millennium. With a good 
  handful of official releases and multiple non-official ones, they've catered 
  for the needs of space rock aficionados in a most prolific manner. &quot;Slip 
  Into the Vortex&quot; is their seventh official production, and their second 
  of 2010. <br>
  When it comes to space rock, OSC belongs to the category of bands who take an 
  improvisational approach. Rather than crafting compositions and planning them 
  to the minutest detail, live performances and improvisations seems to be their 
  key approach. If they start out with a basic idea or if everything forms as 
  their jams move along I don't know, but at this point they appear to master 
  the art of improvisation on a level many others can envy them.</p>
<p>The 78 minutes of material at hand on this occasion is some of the smoothest 
  and slickest I have come across so far from this act. The drums and bass sets 
  the foundation nicely as always, maintaining momentum and establishing a basic 
  motif, synths and Hammond adds spacey sounds and fluctuating textures expertly 
  and the guitar patterns slowly evolve back and forth between soloing, psychedelic 
  licks and drawn out, resonating notes. Not too many riff patterns this time 
  around though, the arrangements and overall sound on this disc is of a lighter 
  and more subtle nature. The addition of saxophone to the proceedings underlines 
  this, and especially the first half of this album gives this new addition to 
  the sonic palette utilized by Dr. Space and his compatriots lots of space to 
  unfold, resulting in songs with subtle jazz tendencies.</p>
<p>Space rock is still the name of the game though, and while I didn't find this 
  excursion quite as captivating as the ones from the last few years, I believe 
  many space cadets will enjoy this album. If you want to zone out for 80 minutes, 
  and immerse yourself in an inner cosmic journey without ever being disturbed 
  before the journey has reached it's destination, this smooth and subtle production 
  comes across as the perfect spaceship for this task<br>
