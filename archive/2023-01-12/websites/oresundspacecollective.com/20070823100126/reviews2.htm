<font color="#CCFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Øresund Space Collective – Promotion CD 2005</b> </font> 
<p><font color="#CCCCFF">Now more bands ought to do what the Øresund Space Collective 
  have done. Conveniently group and label their tracks into genres, thus making 
  the life of the tired reviewer so much easier. So, here we the tracks grouped 
  as funky, jazzy, reggae, spacey and ambient! Genius. You can just swoop into 
  the section you want, depending on what mood you’re in, and off you go. Of course, 
  you run the danger of missing out on certain delights if you’re a prescriptive 
  type of listener. After all, a space rock fan might miss out on the funky gem, 
  ‘The Space Funk Begins’, although the name alone should be enough to drag you 
  in. A self proclaimed “improvised electro-jazz-spacerock outfit, the Øresund 
  Space Collective was formed in April 2004 and is a group of Danish, Swedish 
  and American musicians that get together as often as possible for free form 
  improvised space rock music. The core of the collective features current and 
  former members of the Danish bands Mantric Muse and Gas Giant as well as the 
  Swedish bands Bland Bladen. Occasionally other musicians join as well from other 
  Swedish band like the Carpet Knights and Sgt. Sunshine. Despite the existence 
  of the CD in my hand (or rather CD player), the collective have put all their 
  jams on to their website for your free listening pleasure. At some pointm they 
  plan to release some of these sessions as limited edition CDs, similar to the 
  Quarkspace Spacefold series, but for the moment you can go download crazy, with 
  over 5 hours of material available. Anyone who knows me won’t be surprised to 
  learn that it was the jazzy section that drew me in with both ‘Jazzy Thing’ 
  and ‘Jazz Envelope’ being absolute delights, especially the soaring guitar lead 
  on the former track. Of the spacey numbers, ‘Space Flight’ is a near 12 minute 
  epic delight that covers all the required space rock essentials, with some particularly 
  fine percussive work. It’s a joy to hear music being performed for the sake 
  of the music, and I would urge you to partake immediately! </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Øresund Space Collective: Improvised Electro-Jazz-Space 
  Rock Promotional CD-R </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCFF">ØSC is a loose group of psychedelic musicians (for example 
  from bands like Gas Giant, Bland Bladen and Mantric Muse) from Denmark and Sweden 
  who quite regularly get together to jam on either side of the Øresund bridge. 
  There are 11 musicians playing on this disc that is a compilation of their a 
  bit earlier jams. The funkier side is presented with the two first tracks “The 
  Space Funk Begins” and “Funker”. Rather groovy stuff featuring great guitar 
  solos and nice space effects. The jazz side is included with “Jazzy Thing” and 
  “Jazz Envelope” where the already shown Ozrics influences are full grown. The 
  going just gets better! It’s also nice to hear some keyboard solos. They also 
  know how to play reggae and prove it with “Space Ska Madness” that has a rather 
  tight rhythm but is a very groovy piece. The space sounds are well presented 
  here! As if this wasn’t enough, the guys take us into space next with their 
  jam called “Space Flight”. Edited down to almost 12 minutes, this very inspirational 
  take-off is real space rock and works like crazy. Space is also the destination 
  on the track “Slow Journey into Space”, although in a bit more tranquil and 
  airier manner. Can I hear some Steve Hillage influences here? “Sunrise” ends 
  the disc with its marvellous ambient worlds; beautiful and relaxing. In the 
  middle the drums join in and the flight gets some new dimensions. Great synthesizer 
  stuff. Although the jams were recorded with just two microphones into MD the 
  sound is very bearable. The band is soon going to record a studio jam album, 
  as well, and I for one am waiting for it very much. Before that you should go 
  to their web site where you can download all the jam sessions and live gigs! 
  I hope we can these boys to jam in Finland soon, as well. www.oresundspacecollective.com

<p><font color="#CCCCCC"><b>Øresund Space Collective: Picks from Space Vol. I 
  Self-released CD-R (OSCPFS001) </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Øresund Space Collective is a Danish-Swedish-American 
  co-operative jam project and prior to this release they have released one un-official 
  jam CD-R like this and in early 2006 one proper studio jam album, that I just 
  recently reviewed. This new release was recorded to MD with stereo microphones 
  at rehearsals, but the sound quality is still pretty good. You can easily get 
  into the psychedelic, burbling and groovy sounds of this band with this kind 
  of sound, as well. As always in jamming, there are also some not so perfect 
  moments, but these have been also apparently edited. The music is usually rather 
  spirited and sunny, but there is also some darker material in there like the 
  great “Toes”. Some of the songs are paced with the pulsating sequencers. There 
  is also a bit of jazzy touch. Gong and Ozric Tentacles might be the closest 
  comparison most of the time. The over 19 minutes long “Spacecake” is, as the 
  title suggests, a journey into inner and outer space, simultaneously. Great 
  playing and amazing emotional charges. The delay guitar on “Flying Free” reminds 
  me of the first album by Psychomuzak, and occasionally also Ashra. It’s nice 
  that there are also some Eastern feel in the end! This band also rocks in a 
  nice, spacious way when needed. This disc started the seven-part series of the 
  band’s best, edited rehearsal jams, and you can order all issues from their 
  web site on CD-R or as an MP3 download. Collect the whole series! </font></p>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC"><b>Øresund Space Commune: Picks from Space Vol. II Self-released 
  CD-R (OSCPFS002) </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">This is the second volume in the rehearsal improvisation 
  series of this international psychedelic space rock band. All the four, long 
  tracks are from one specific rehearsals that took place in Sweden on 22.10.2004. 
  The recording technique is the same than on the other volumes, so the sound 
  is good enough but not amazing. On this recording the drums are a tad too loud 
  most of the time, but on the other hand it might enhance the groovy atmosphere. 
  The album is opened with an over 19 minutes long “Off We Go” that starts rather 
  quietly and in a percussive way in a bit of reggae style. Little by little the 
  track grows and has some excellent guitar playing towards the end. As the title 
  says “Jazzy Thing” is a jazzy, groovy number with a repetitive, effective bass 
  line. Also the longest track (26:31) on the disc called “Spacegroove” is very 
  groovy and starts with a sort of disco drum comp and features some tasty piano 
  sounds in the end. “To the End of the Galaxy” continues without a break and 
  has some delay guitar, a bit funky rhythm and plenty of space sounds from the 
  synthesisers. This is a very good summary of one rehearsal sessions by this 
  excellent improvisational group and it proves that these guys can play and improvise 
  together very well. </font></p>
