  <strong>&Oslash;resund Space Collective-Entering into the Space Country </strong>
  <p>Review by Gary Hill</p>
  <p>I believe this album from OSC is a vinyl only release. However, I was given
    a CDr of the music from which to write my review. As always from this group,
    we&#8217;re given a slab of improvised space rock. In a lot of ways, though,
    these jams wander into different territory than a lot of their other discs.
    Hawkwind is seldom a reference here, even though that band really defines space
    rock in the minds of many. At points this moves towards fusion. At other times
    you will likely hear early Pink Floyd. Other parts of the disc call to mind
    The Allman Brothers. All in all, though, this is a highly enjoyable set of space
    rock jams. <br>

    <br>
    Born Between Stars<br>
    While Hawkwind is always an easy reference when discussing the music of &Oslash;resund
    Space Collective, this builds up gradually in something that&#8217;s closer
    to a mix of early Pink Floyd and Nektar. As it continues, the space rock explosion
    is preserved, but it seems to wander close to fusion at times. Then around the
    seven minute mark it drops down to a mellower motif. The cut grows out from
    there moving through a number of changes and alterations. As all good space
    music, though, nothing happens quickly, rather the music transforms in a steady,
    but almost unnoticed way. It&#8217;s kind of like clouds changing shape as they
    float through the sky. You don&#8217;t really notice the change as it happens,
    but then find yourself in completely different musical territory. There&#8217;s
    some killer instrumental interplay later in the tune. This is a stomping hot
    space rock jam. Around the seventeen and a half minute mark it tears out into
    a screaming guitar solo section that calls to mind Jimi Hendrix and others.
    It turns out to more atmospheric jamming from there. Later a bouncing sort of
    interplay ensues to take the cut out. At almost twenty two and a half minutes
    in length, this is an epic length piece and the longest track on show.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Rising Tides And Floating Nebulas<br>
    This comes in tentatively and feels more like Hawkwind at the onset than the
    previous piece ever did. An almost old school rock and roll bass line enters
    and the cut moves out in different directions with hard edged jamming over that
    driving rhythm section. As it builds up from there it takes on a mode that&#8217;s
    almost like a space rock take on the Allman Brothers. This thing really rises
    up toward the stratosphere as it continues. It&#8217;s certainly one part jam
    band and one part space rock, but those two styles are never that far removed
    from one another. They drop it way down around the eight and a half minute mark
    and as it comes back up it resemble Pink Floyd&#8217;s &#8220;Careful with that
    Axe, Eugene&#8221; a bit to my ears. Eventually that&#8217;s transformed into
    a slow moving groove that&#8217;s very much more standard progressive rock than
    space rock. There is even a little fusion mixed in there. The piece weighs in
    at almost fourteen and a half minutes, making it short compared the opener,
    but still quite massive. <br>
    <br>
    Red Earth Calling<br>
    Eastern tones bring this in and the cut grows in understated ways at first.
    Comparisons to Hawkind have merit as it begins to rise upward. Psychedelic and
    Eastern sounds swirled around in a space rock motif as this piece continues
    to evolve. At less than seven and a half minutes in length, it&#8217;s the shortest
    track of the set. <br>

      Entering into the Space Country</a></p>
  <p><br>
    In 1969 the United States government, in cooperation with the USSR and the Republic
    of China, began work on a secret probe which, once launched into space, would
    begin broadcasting various sound bites and bits of information at an ultra-high
    frequency in the hopes that any sentient life with equal or greater technology
    that might be listening in would pick up our signal and transmit back. The goal
    was to establish an interstellar dialogue for the first time in the history
    of mankind, and they succeeded as in 1978, nine short years after the secret
    launch of Hermes I, a transmission in the form of a 45 minute sound loop, repeating
    endlessly and coming through on an ultra-low frequency, was first received by
    analysts at the station base situated atop Gangkhar Puensum. Thirty-two years
    later the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence remains the best kept secret
    among our world governing bodies, but as a way of gauging the public&#8217;s
    reaction to a revelation of this magnitude, the recording of that first contact
    has been declassified and made available under a false name: Entering into the
    Space Country.<br>
    None of what you just read is true, but it&#8217;s the best way to describe
    the aesthetic of the &Oslash;resund Space Collective to someone who has not
    had the distinct pleasure of experiencing it firsthand. Their sound is out of
    this world. Entering into the Space Country is the Collective&#8217;s third
    of four records released this year (their eleventh since 2006). If nothing else,
    the band deserves praise for their prolificacy. My &Oslash;SC introduction came
    when Dead Man in Space, which dropped in April, was sent to me for review. I
    became a fan immediately of the improvisational approach they took to creating
    grooves so deep they might be mistaken for ruts.<br>
    Space Country is less amorphous than Dead Man, due in no small part to the prominence
    of the guitars. This album is driven by actual notes rather than defined by
    textures. Notes coaxed, cajoled, coerced and downright strangled out of several
    electric guitars. There are major (and by major I mean noticeable) changes at
    roughly seven minute intervals throughout &#8220;Born Between Stars&#8221; the
    albums opening track. In fact, this album could almost be broken down perfectly
    into seven-minute intervals, six of them in fact, with subtle or sometimes very
    drastic changes occurring at or around each one: three for &#8220;Born Between
    Stars,&#8221; two for &#8220;Rising Tides and Floating Nebulas&#8221; and wedged
    right in between is the runt of the litter at just seven minutes: &#8220;Red
    Earth Calling.&#8221;<br>
    What sets Entering into the Space Country apart from previous &Oslash;SC efforts
    can be summed up succinctly in one word: Noodling. Guitars steal the show here.
    The synth textures and tones take a back seat to riffs and licks in what is
    considerably more of a jam band sound than I had come to expect, but it is not
    surprising considering what the Collective has in common with many jam bands:
    a rotating line up, complex and extended improvisation on simple themes and
    motifs, they&#8217;re probably way better live than in a studio setting, &amp;c.
    If these guys make it to the states, I see them making a splash on the festival
    circuit. </p>
