      Jam Session #4, Copenhagen November 6th, 2004</font>

  <p>
    <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00">We were slated to begin at 15 (3Pm).
      I picked up Ola and Dave from Bland Bladen at the main trainstation, right on
      time at 14:45. We went to the pharmacy so Ola could get some earplugs and off
      to the rehearsal room. S&oslash;ren was already there. Magnus was suppose to
      be here at 13 but had not shown up. We started setting up a bit and then Ola
      and I went off to by some beer. We got a case of Heineken and two six packs
      of Julehvil but accident. This is the very sweet low alcohol kids starter beer!
      Yuck! </font>

    <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFF00"> Still no Magnus when we got back
      and no contact the whole day. We finally hear from him around 3:45 and he had
      been out drinking all night and did not get home until 11 this morning. Serious
      guy, eh??? He shows up at 5 and we have already started the first jam. He picks
      up his guitar and starts to fly during the second track. It was a strange night
      with lots of joints and beers and massive amounts of synthesiers, sometimes
      4 people playing at once! Like Mogens says, &quot;You can never have too many
      synthesizers!&quot;. We play 3 sets of jams lasting about 3&frac12; hrs. Nearly
      everything is recorded and you can hear some of the sessions now. </font>
