    The &Oslash;resund Space Collective was formed in April 2004. The collective
    is a group of Danish, Swedish and American musicians that get together as often
    as possible for free form improvised space rock music. The flavour of the music
    is different with each session. The jams can often combine complex interplay
    between guitar and synthesizer as well intense drumming and bass playing. We
    enter into the genre of funk, jazz, reggae and space and stoner rock as we improvise
    our way along. The jam sessions alternate between Malm&ouml; and K&oslash;benhavn
    across the &Oslash;resund bridge! The core of the collective features current
    and former members of the Danish bands Mantric Muse and Gas Giant as well as
    the Swedish bands Bland Bladen, Derango, and the Carpet Knights. Occasionally
    other musicians join as well from other Swedish band like the Sgt Sunshine,
    Siena Root, Drahk von Trip and Kaabel. Recently, we have been joined by Sula
    Bassana from Germany!<br>
    <br>
    The collective records all of the jam sessions and makes these available to
    fans via the web site in MP3 format. We currently have over 40 hours of material
    on the web site for free download. The bands debut CD was released on the Transubstans
    label <a href="http://www.recoredheaven.net">(www.recoredheaven.net</a>) from
    Malm&ouml;, Sweden in January 2006. IT was a limited edition of 500 numbered
    copies for the first pressing. The band has also released a series of 12 CD-Rs
    called Picks from Space which feature the best of the jam sessions 1-27. In
    March 2006, the band completed its latest studio session. This was released
    in October 2006 as a double CD in a deluxe DVD case and called &quot;It's all
    about Delay&quot;. The bands 3rd CD, The Black Tomato, was released in a deluxe
    digpack format in 1000 copies in August 2007. The bands 4th CD was released
    on Sept 26th, 2008 on the <a href="http://www.sulatron.com">Sulatron Label</a>
    and it is called Inside your Head.
