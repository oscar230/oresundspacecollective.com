  <p>
    <font color="#CCCCFF">Now more bands ought to do what the �resund Space Collective
      have done. Conveniently group and label their tracks into genres, thus making
      the life of the tired reviewer so much easier. So, here we the tracks grouped
      as funky, jazzy, reggae, spacey and ambient! Genius. You can just swoop into
      the section you want, depending on what mood you�re in, and off you go. Of course,
      you run the danger of missing out on certain delights if you�re a prescriptive
      type of listener. After all, a space rock fan might miss out on the funky gem,
      �The Space Funk Begins�, although the name alone should be enough to drag you
      in. A self proclaimed �improvised electro-jazz-spacerock outfit, the �resund
      Space Collective was formed in April 2004 and is a group of Danish, Swedish
      and American musicians that get together as often as possible for free form
      improvised space rock music. The core of the collective features current and
      former members of the Danish bands Mantric Muse and Gas Giant as well as the
      Swedish bands Bland Bladen. Occasionally other musicians join as well from other
      Swedish band like the Carpet Knights and Sgt. Sunshine. Despite the existence
      of the CD in my hand (or rather CD player), the collective have put all their
      jams on to their website for your free listening pleasure. At some pointm they
      plan to release some of these sessions as limited edition CDs, similar to the
      Quarkspace Spacefold series, but for the moment you can go download crazy, with
      over 5 hours of material available. Anyone who knows me won�t be surprised to
      learn that it was the jazzy section that drew me in with both �Jazzy Thing�
      and �Jazz Envelope� being absolute delights, especially the soaring guitar lead
      on the former track. Of the spacey numbers, �Space Flight� is a near 12 minute
      epic delight that covers all the required space rock essentials, with some particularly
      fine percussive work. It�s a joy to hear music being performed for the sake
      of the music, and I would urge you to partake immediately! </font>

    <font color="#CCCCFF">�SC is a loose group of psychedelic musicians (for example
      from bands like Gas Giant, Bland Bladen and Mantric Muse) from Denmark and Sweden
      who quite regularly get together to jam on either side of the �resund bridge.
      There are 11 musicians playing on this disc that is a compilation of their a
      bit earlier jams. The funkier side is presented with the two first tracks �The
      Space Funk Begins� and �Funker�. Rather groovy stuff featuring great guitar
      solos and nice space effects. The jazz side is included with �Jazzy Thing� and
      �Jazz Envelope� where the already shown Ozrics influences are full grown. The
      going just gets better! It�s also nice to hear some keyboard solos. They also
      know how to play reggae and prove it with �Space Ska Madness� that has a rather
      tight rhythm but is a very groovy piece. The space sounds are well presented
      here! As if this wasn�t enough, the guys take us into space next with their
      jam called �Space Flight�. Edited down to almost 12 minutes, this very inspirational
      take-off is real space rock and works like crazy. Space is also the destination
      on the track �Slow Journey into Space�, although in a bit more tranquil and
      airier manner. Can I hear some Steve Hillage influences here? �Sunrise� ends
      the disc with its marvellous ambient worlds; beautiful and relaxing. In the
      middle the drums join in and the flight gets some new dimensions. Great synthesizer
      stuff. Although the jams were recorded with just two microphones into MD the
      sound is very bearable. The band is soon going to record a studio jam album,
      as well, and I for one am waiting for it very much. Before that you should go
      to their web site where you can download all the jam sessions and live gigs!
      I hope we can these boys to jam in Finland soon, as well. www.oresundspacecollective.com

        Self-released CD-R (OSCPFS001) </b></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#CCCCCC">�resund Space Collective is a Danish-Swedish-American
      co-operative jam project and prior to this release they have released one un-official
      jam CD-R like this and in early 2006 one proper studio jam album, that I just
      recently reviewed. This new release was recorded to MD with stereo microphones
      at rehearsals, but the sound quality is still pretty good. You can easily get
      into the psychedelic, burbling and groovy sounds of this band with this kind
      of sound, as well. As always in jamming, there are also some not so perfect
      moments, but these have been also apparently edited. The music is usually rather
      spirited and sunny, but there is also some darker material in there like the
      great �Toes�. Some of the songs are paced with the pulsating sequencers. There
      is also a bit of jazzy touch. Gong and Ozric Tentacles might be the closest
      comparison most of the time. The over 19 minutes long �Spacecake� is, as the
      title suggests, a journey into inner and outer space, simultaneously. Great
      playing and amazing emotional charges. The delay guitar on �Flying Free� reminds
      me of the first album by Psychomuzak, and occasionally also Ashra. It�s nice
      that there are also some Eastern feel in the end! This band also rocks in a
      nice, spacious way when needed. This disc started the seven-part series of the
      band�s best, edited rehearsal jams, and you can order all issues from their
      web site on CD-R or as an MP3 download. Collect the whole series! </font>

    <font color="#CCCCCC"><b>�resund Space Commune: Picks from Space Vol. II Self-released
        CD-R (OSCPFS002) </b></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#CCCCCC">This is the second volume in the rehearsal improvisation
      series of this international psychedelic space rock band. All the four, long
      tracks are from one specific rehearsals that took place in Sweden on 22.10.2004.
      The recording technique is the same than on the other volumes, so the sound
      is good enough but not amazing. On this recording the drums are a tad too loud
      most of the time, but on the other hand it might enhance the groovy atmosphere.
      The album is opened with an over 19 minutes long �Off We Go� that starts rather
      quietly and in a percussive way in a bit of reggae style. Little by little the
      track grows and has some excellent guitar playing towards the end. As the title
      says �Jazzy Thing� is a jazzy, groovy number with a repetitive, effective bass
      line. Also the longest track (26:31) on the disc called �Spacegroove� is very
      groovy and starts with a sort of disco drum comp and features some tasty piano
      sounds in the end. �To the End of the Galaxy� continues without a break and
      has some delay guitar, a bit funky rhythm and plenty of space sounds from the
      synthesisers. This is a very good summary of one rehearsal sessions by this
      excellent improvisational group and it proves that these guys can play and improvise
      together very well. </font>

    <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Øresund Space Collective: Picks from Space
        Vol. 3 &amp; Vol. 4 <br>
        Sel-released CD-R's</strong></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF"> The Danish-Swedish psychedelic improvisation collective
      has carried on the jam series recorded at their rehearsals; volumes 8 to 10
      are already available. I’m still only at volumes 3 and four that were
      recorded late 2004 and early 2005 in Copenhagen. The sound quality on these
      discs is very good, and the group is developing musically all the time. I’m
      dying to hear how good these guys are on their latest releases! Vol. 3 begins
      with an airy, marvellous Ozrics-styled jam ”Glide Ride with Magnus”
      where Magnus plays some great guitar stuff. Also the keyboards and sound effects
      work perfectly. Then follows “Space Ska Madness” and the title tells
      everything you need to know. The long “Deep and Dark” is more peaceful,
      a bit incoherent number that still has its good moments. Towards the end it
      gets quite jazzy. The best track on this album is absolutely ”Yeah!!!!!!!!”
      that starts off with a synthesizer. Then a rather intensive jam begins bringing
      to mind Ash Ra Temple a bit. Really psychedelic and excellent stuff! The piano
      sound works great on top of all the web of delay. The track also has some great
      guitar playing, and my only complaint is that it “only” lasts for
      6:19… The disc closes with 15:36 long “Tolkien Jam” that begins
      with a Tangerine Dream-sounding sequence. At around three minutes the drum comp
      joins in and the track begins to sound more like the Ozric Tentacles. Some great
      guitar on this one, as well. Superb!</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
      On Vol. 4 the theme is space funk, so the first jam is called ”Space Funk
      Begins”. Airy, nice and a bit jazzy stuff. The guitars are well present
      on this album. The groovy ”Slow Journey into Space” continues the
      same theme increasing the amount of space effects. “Journey Picks up Speed”
      is, as the title suggests, tighter, excellent track that has a straighter drum
      beat and skilful guitar soloing. ”Space Funker Enters the Black Hole”
      is at first very funky, but later on changes more relaxing. You can also hear
      some Fender Rhodes, which is nice. The most wobbly track on this disc is “Space
      Funker pt 2” that doesn’t have that much going on. Also in a quite
      lame way begins the next jam “Funk-o-Rama” that is the longest on
      the disc, but before nine minutes have passed a wild funking begins and a really
      spacey delay guitar explodes your mind! Oh yeah! The ending piece “GrooveFO”
      is just synthesizer bubbling at first. A mystical space mood. Later on there
      comes some very effective, psychedelic delay guitar that works very well in
      deed. An excellent way to end a very good jam album! I can recommend both of
      these albums with cosmic warmth to everyone into psychedelic improvisation.
      The band is also halfway through the mixing of their new studio 2CD, and that
      album will be sublime, for sure…</font>

  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF"> Here are a couple more volumes to the series that presents
      the rehearsal goodies of this excellent commune that plays totally improvised
      space rock. The band’s rehearsal jams just get better and better all the
      time, I’m afraid to think what they will achieve one day… Vol. 5
      is really psychedelic and spaced out. In spite of the rather primitive recording
      method all the instruments are in balance and you can hear everything very well.
      There are four long, cosmic tracks on the album called ”Opening Space
      Flight”, ”Stoned in Our Zone”, ”Stoners in Space”
      and ”Sunrise”. All of them work flawlessly and there is some wilder
      jamming as well as celestial, peaceful floating. In particular, the beautiful
      “Sunrise” is a really airy, great and psychedelic flight pretty
      much in the same vein as the slower output of Ozric Tentacles. There is a lot
      of excellent synth stuff on the album as well as twin-guitar webs of delay.
      The rhythm section is as tight, groovy and inventive as ever. Great!</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">Vol. 6 is bit different in nature than the other volumes
      so far. Eduardo from Sgt. Sunshine is guesting on guitar, and the music is somehow
      funkier and jazzier than before, due to Eduardo’s wah wah work, among
      other things. “The Cuban Sex Groove” could easily be Gong, but without
      vocals. “Trance Pants” also features some groovy conga. The electronics
      work very well. There are some superb guitars solos also on this disc. “Heavy
      Spacehead Needs Food” is rather heavy stuff in a real space rock spirit.
      That, and especially the next track “Hook in Mouth” has some regretful
      cut offs due to the errors in recording, but there really isn’t anything
      else to complain about. “Funky Mood Dub” is exactly what is promises.
      If you get your kicks from instrumental, improvised space rock, it’s really
      worthwhile to get these albums!</font>

  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF"> This Danish-Swedish psychedelic, improvisational space
      rock group has gotten to Vol. 10 in their rehearsal jam series, and volumes
      11 and 12 should be available soon, but I’m a bit behind with these reviews
      (sorry guys!). The band played their first gig in Helsinki last month at our
      club, and they will hopefully return this autumn.</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">Picks from Space Vol. 7 includes three long, at least
      20-minute-long and one closer to 12 min. jams that were recorded on the Danish
      side of the bridge in May 2005. The band at this session was Sebastian: guitar,
      Søren: drums, Michael: bass, Mogens: synthesizers, Dr. Space: synthesizer,
      Ola: synthesizers and Magnus: guitar. The sound quality is very good, considering
      that the rehearsals were recorded directly to Minidisc using stereo microphones.
      “Into the Unknown” begins very peacefully with space sounds and
      light guitar before two minutes have gone the drums join in gradually. At first
      the comp is slow and the synths are playing the lead while the guitars wake
      up little by little. After seven minutes the space trip really begins and we
      get to hear some really excellent stuff! I’m a bit reminded of Ozric Tentacles.
      The end gets peaceful again. ”Who Said We Were Tired” starts right
      away with a rather groovy touch and the guitar work is a lot more intense on
      this one. It has a sort of funky feel and the beat is maintained for the full
      duration except for the last few seconds. “Lay Me Down” goes at
      first in mid-tempo, but after 12 minutes it gets wilder and really starts to
      rock. Wow, great stuff! This has an uplifting effect with all the space noises.
      The jam also has some great guitar solos. They go in just one chord as usual.
      The rhythm slows down and towards the end there is some more laid-back, a bit
      jazzy stuff (especially the bass). “Ride the Sky” sounds at first
      a bit unusual for OSC, it has clean guitars and this is not as spacey as usual,
      although it includes a couple of synths. Pretty beautiful stuff. At around the
      four-minute-marker the delays kick in and we’re in the psych world again!
      This track has a lot of suction and drive plus some really nice soloing. After
      11 minutes the drums cool down again. This is an amazing disc!</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">Vol. 8 includes six jams’ worth of material recorded
      at two separate sessions in September and October 2005, and this time there
      is also some clarinet and percussion and Emil on synth and Tobias on guitar.
      ”Waiting for the Space Attack” begins with some synths and is an
      OK, mid-tempo jam that soon gets more intense. At around the seven-minute-marker
      it cools down again and the drums drop out for a while. Not long after a faster
      beat begins and all kinds of interesting stuff like solos follow. Then they
      cool down again, and it feels like they’re a bit lost for a while with
      a strange, bit jazzy rhythm. Then comes some hazy, synth-oriented trance stuff,
      but there are also some delay guitar patterns in there. “Ghosts in My
      Head” begins pretty much without a break and has an unbelievably heavy
      riff. This goes on with little less synthesizer and there seems to be some confusion
      in the air. “The Rats Are at the Bottom” includes some really great
      going with a disco comp and excellent guitar solos. “OSC Reggae Astronaut”
      is in deed reggae at one point, but soon changes into something totally different.
      “Hyperdrive” is at first slower, but after the guitar solo we get
      to hear heavier riffing again. The last track “OSC Shafted” is a
      really groovy, funky jam that also includes clarinet and percussion. It’s
      really nice to hear some new instruments in the band’s music that benefits
      a lot from new tones. There will be some violin on the next studio album, which
      will fit in nicely for sure! OSC is a really great band and I’d say it’s
      worthwhile to get also all these rehearsal discs.</font>

      Self-released CD-R's</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF"> The Danish-Swedish-American OSC has again released a
      couple of CD-R’s worth of psychedelic, instrumental improvisation-based
      space jamming, and that’s great. Vol. 11 is a bit exceptional in this
      series because instead of rehearsal jams it includes studio recordings with
      high quality sound. Some of the tracks are out-takes from their three different
      album sessions, but there are also previously unreleased, whole versions of
      a couple of tracks (”Falling Stardrops&gt;Explode into Space” and
      ”Viking Cleaner”). So this will be a really treat for all the fans
      of the band!</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">”Falling Stardrops&gt;Explode into Space”
      begins peacefully with synthesizer, the rest join in after a few minutes and
      there is also some psychedelic narration. Then we get a guitar solo and some
      nice Rhodes melodies. The track gets more intense, there is some hallucinatory
      space sounds in the middle, and the rest is wild stuff in the Ozrics vein. Great!
      “Space Burst Cinema” is a rather fast, pretty cool track that changes
      into reggae at some point. I do understand why the track was left off the album,
      but it’s still a pretty good number. ”Øresund Space Boogie”
      starts off in an exciting, bit funky manner. The track floats in a nice way
      without actually going into any specific direction. ”Chased by the Space
      Police” starts to rock fast and includes some really great going. At times
      it goes prog, and also includes some jazzy moods. The end is really fierce with
      killer guitar solos! “Jam 14” is a mid-tempo, guitar-driven jam
      that grows around the seven-minute-marker. The album’s best improvisation
      “Viking Cleaner” also has the best sound quality and it’s
      a really superb track with a totally cosmic suction that takes you straight
      into space. Amazing!</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFFFF">Vol. 12 includes five tracks from three different rehearsal
      jam sessions of the collective. The three first jams are the first ones to feature
      Gas Giant guitarist Stefan creating the heavy grooves and playing top-notch
      solos. “Chuck Eats the Uranium” is shorter than usual at 4:32 and
      a rather groovy, Ozrics-like jam that rocks harder towards the end. The over
      20-minute-long, epic” Guitar Players Battle in Space to Consume the Synth
      Player” has some jazzy stuff, cools down for small, strange space sounds,
      and then Stefan is let loose to play a bluesy solo. In the end the track rocks
      in a very tight and wild way. This works! “Express Yourself” is
      at first a bit more experimental, then a pretty laid-back and emotional track
      that at times gets more intense. ”Anyone Seen Carlos?” has in the
      beginning a reggae rhythm and delay guitar and lots of superb space sounds.
      Then they gradually speed up towards the heart of the cosmos. The older jam
      ”Cruisin’ with the OSC” has a bit surprisingly better sound
      quality and this surely is a really great, quite progressive track where everyone
      plays really well. The atmosphere is really psychedelic. Both of these CD-R’s
      are very helpful when we are waiting for the next studio album that should be
      out this spring.</font>
