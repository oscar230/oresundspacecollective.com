  <em>#1 You are a truly multinational band, you have members from Denmark, Sweden
    and America &#8211; do you all live close to each other? Or is the need to play
    enough to drive across borders? Do you hang out outside of jams, or do you only
    meet up for studio and live sessions? </em>
  <p>Scott: We are an international band, for sure. Most of us live quite close
    to each other but Sebastian lives 500km away in the forest in Sweden so he drives
    or takes the train down when we have jam sessions or concerts. The rest live
    in Malm&ouml; or Copenhagen (just a 40min drive or train trip from each other)
    so the distance is not a big problem. Oh yeah.. Michael lives in Roskilde, about
    30km from Copenhagen.. We do hang out together a lot of us and go see shows
    together, birthday parties, Christmas parties, etc.. A lot of us were together
    at the recent Witchcraft and Dead Man concert, as we like the same kinds of
    music. </p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#2 You actually left the safe haven of a well known and published band Gas
      Giant to help form Oresund Space Collective&#8230;. Why the move? O.S.C. is
      many miles away in vibe to Gas Giant, although perhaps in the periphery of the
      same scene&#8230; are there any less obvious similarities? Do you still dig
      the heavier space vibe, or was this more of a creative urge?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: Well, I did not leave on my own. I was asked to leave Gas Giant as they
    wanted to explore and go in a less spacey direction and felt they did not want
    the synthesizer anymore, so I was left without a band to play in and decided
    to try to get some of my music friends from Mantric Muse (<a
      href="http://www.mantricmuse.dk">www.mantricmuse.dk</a>)
    and Bland Bladen (<a href="http://www.blandbladen.tk">www.blandbladen.tk</a>)
    together for some jamming and it worked out so well, we ended up as a band (collective).
    Well, Gas Giant was a band, that played songs but did a lot of jamming and improvisation,
    while the OSC is pure improvisation, so it is hard to compare the two bands.
    I think the vibe is not miles away from Gas Giant, as both bands have their
    psyche in the same places..</p>
  <p>As for the heavier space vibe, we are currently heading in this direction,
    which is something we have not really explored that much on our studio CDs.
    It is not that we don&#8217;t play heavy stuff but we never plan what we are
    going to play and in the studio, people are high and flying and we go wherever
    the music takes us and so far that has not been into the heavy stuff, except
    with the track, In her Majesty&#8217;s Secret Saucer! Wait until you hear the
    studio stuff we recorded in November 2006. A few pretty heavy riffs come to
    the surface..</p>
  <p><em><br>
      #3 You are a completely improvisational space rock band. Each time you play
      is a totally different experience, don&#8217;t you ever find yourself going
      over old ground? Doesn&#8217;t the well of inspiration ever dry up? You do have
      a pretty recognisable sound, its not like your style changes dramatically between
      tracks, how do you find inspiration to make each track so distinct?</em></p>
  <p>Scott: So far, I would say we have not been going over the same ground, yet..but
    as far as inspiration goes, some members have been feeling like they do need
    to take a break and this is why we are bringing in some new people to play from
    bands like Gas Giant and Drahk von Trip, to give some of the members a break.
    This will also bring in a new creative energy that will inspire people to play
    differently. I agree, we do somehow have an OSC sound now, which I think is
    largely due to the solid bass, drum and guitar work of the Mantric Muse core.
    Magnus, the leader of Mantric Muse and one of our lead guitar players give us
    a very unique signature sound when combined with our other players, which is
    quite unique. In addition, the rest are all musicians who have spent a lot of
    time jamming in the rehearsal rooms with all sorts of bands but in this environment,
    we can all fly together in the OSC space rocket and it seems to go pretty well.
  </p>
  <p>I think to follow the track of inspiration, one must listen to the whole of
    a single jam session. We have thought about making a download so people could
    download a whole session not just one jam at a time. Anyway, to follow the track
    of inspiration, you really need to sit down, drink, smoke, whatever you do and
    relax and listen, then you can go on a trip and see how an OSC night evolves.
    How the jams go in one direction, the flow will be pretty amazing and we are
    all tripping together and then it gets a bit mixed up and we then come back
    together and it heads in another direction. Our inspiration at any given time
    in a jam is what we are hearing from the others and what we know we can play
    that might add something or we are willing to experiment with a new sound, etc....
    They are always interesting and rarely the same, the jams.</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#4 You aim to record every 6-8 months or so&#8230; Have you managed to keep
      up this goal? Your latest release is a double cd clocking in at over two and
      a half hours long&#8230; How long are you in the studio for? How much material
      do you need to cut out to get these best tracks? I assume you don&#8217;t keep
      everything!</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: I would like to release a new record every 6-8 months. We are a creative
    bunch of people and we have a core of really dedicated space rock fans, we enjoy
    what we are doing, and we have a great and very supportive record label, so
    for now, we keep it up. I think this is the only way in the music world to be
    able to get a big enough audience that we will be able to play all over the
    world for the fans someday. </p>
  <p>When we hit the studio, we have 2 days to record. Most of the first day is
    setting up the gear and getting the sound right and then having a few jams and
    then the next day we record a lot. We average to record 5-6 hrs of stuff and
    then we sort through it all. Most of the jams you here are of course pieces
    of longer jams that we edit the beginning or the ends of. We usually jam from
    30-75 minutes at a time and then take a break, have a beer and a smoke and listen
    and go back in again. We don&#8217;t keep everything for the CD releases but
    we do have all the music and the fans can hear nearly all of the music that
    we recorded, even what is not on the CDs, on our web site. For It&#8217;s all
    about Delay, we recorded about 330 minutes and came away with 200 minutes of
    great stuff. We still have 3 unreleased tracks from this session that are mixed,
    the rest is only in rough mix form. </p>
  <p><em>#5 Will all your follow up releases be of a similar length? I guess you
      can&#8217;t predict that at this time, but is it an aim? Do you have any further
      label interest?</em></p>
  <p>Scott: The next release will be a single CD. 2&frac12; hrs of music is a lot
    to release at once but this was a very special session and we are very proud
    of the music on Its all about Delay. I think we will mix up single and double
    CD releases depending on how good the recording sessions are. Our next CD due
    out in May will be a single CD, around 79 minutes long. As for other labels,
    we have had some interest but Transubstans is really doing a good job for us.
  </p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#6 You have ten self-released album length cd&#8217;s available to buy,
      kinda reminding me of the old Ozrics trip when they released all those cassettes
      in the mid-late 80&#8217;s. They are now released as proper cd&#8217;s on their
      own label, and licensed to major labels for decent distribution. Can you see
      yourselves ever going down the same road given the opportunity? Do they sell
      well?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: I really do hope that one day that our CD-R series can be pressed as
    real CDs, even if we only make 100-200 copies of each. Some of our coolest music
    we have ever made is on these CD-Rs. As for how they sell, we have sold around
    20 sets of the whole series of 10. Not a lot but enough to make it worth making
    these available for people. </p>
  <p><em>#7 You have a large core group of members &#8211; eight in fact, and then
      when you play live you often add more on top&#8230; Is there ever a danger of
      your sound becoming confused, or jumbled? Do you find instruments being completely
      lost in the mix? Apart from the logistics of organising that many people to
      arrive for a gig together, how do you all fit on stage?!!!</em></p>
  <p>Scott: We are getting down to a core of 7-8 live and we had one gig with 6!
    I think we can manage with 6 people but this is as small as we can get. We need
    two guitars and two synthesizers, this is crucial plus bass and drums. Sometimes
    we don&#8217;t fit on the small stages. At our CD release party (we were 8),
    Ola, had to set up on the floor as there was not room on the stage. At the moment
    we are stripped down to 6-7 for the live shows as we don&#8217;t have the congas
    now (maybe as a guest on a number or two for local gigs). We don&#8217;t really
    have a problem with the instruments being lost in the mix (not at least for
    me, who stands in the center and can hear everyone!). Perhaps, those on the
    sides don&#8217;t hear everything that well, especially when we don&#8217;t
    have monitors!</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#8 I think as much as you are a space rock band, there is a definite prog
      element to your style&#8230; long, winding jams that take you on journeys of
      the mind, as much as the obvious psychedelic component too. Do you pigeonhole
      your sound? What I mean is, do you try to remain within the confines of a space
      rock style, or do you let your creative vision take you outside these boundaries
      within a jam?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: Well, I think we don&#8217;t limit ourselves in anyway and prog rock,
    space rock, krautrock, electronica, whatever, are just words to describe us
    and we are all of those things. I just try to strip it down to space AND Rock.
    We play rock music and it is spacey. We are for sure a lot like the bands of
    the progressive rock genre but we are not writing any compositions, there is
    no defined structure to what we play and I think that is a very important element
    of prog rock that we don&#8217;t have. The people I play with are excellent
    musicians and can play the most complex stuff you could imagine in strange time
    signatures, etc.. but we play what we feel like playing, 100% from the soul
    of our being, creating music in the time and space that we exist at that moment.......</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#9 Obviously live you are as much a improvised act as in the studio, the
      only difference being that you cant edit out the &#8216;bad&#8217; bits - to
      what extent are your sets made up of basic structures or simple riffs or links
      that you all recognise and can enlarge on? I guess you have your &#8216;off&#8217;
      shows, but are they more &#8216;off&#8217; to you than the audience realises?
      Do you record all your shows the same way you record studio jams?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: Well, the live experience is more challenging in some ways as you have
    to try to bring up your standard in someway as there is an audience but again,
    they won&#8217;t recognize what we think are too loose or not very cool, at
    least at the time. So far, we have treated the live shows as we would any other
    show and we don&#8217;t have any structure at all. We might discuss what key
    to play in or if we should play something uptempo or ambient but that is about
    it. I think in the future, we might start coming up with some riffs that people
    can recognize each time they hear us and these might very well be from cover
    songs, that we will steal a riff and then take it off into the OSC space zone&#8230;</p>
  <p> We record all of our shows and put the whole unedited shows up for complete
    download at the www.archive.org. IT is not for us to decide what is good or
    bad. One person might think a jam is loose, strange, what the fuck are they
    doing and another person might think that was the coolest jam of the night,
    when people were freaking out, not knowing what to play or what direction to
    go. Once we play the music, the music belongs to the fans. They can do whatever
    they want with it but I think they should have the option to hear everything
    we have ever done and decide for themselves if they like it or not. IT is very
    personable. </p>
  <p><em><br>
      #10 Is there the temptation to start introducing structure to your music to
      create &#8216;better&#8217; songs that can be reproduced live? You have obviously
      thought about this as a band and decided against it, so what is the advantage
      in not doing this?</em></p>
  <p>Scott: I think it will happen eventually but not now. All of the players in
    the collective, except myself are part of active bands, who have songs and make
    CDs, etc.. so OSC is more of a total improvisational artistic thing for these
    players and they have songs in their other bands, so we have decided not to
    make songs in this band, at this time. It could change.. The advantage is no
    one has to remember anything from each time we play together&#8230;</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#11 You have members in several other well known acts; I believe you recently
      added the guitar player from Gas Giant who you also played with years ago &#8211;
      has this added any weight to your sound? Are there gonna be fat riffs?! Is he
      just sessioning or is it a side project of his?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: It is great to play with Stefan again. He will be a member of the collective
    but more of a session player who comes in from time to time to play with us.
    He will perform with us a few times in the next months to get used to us and
    us to him. Yes.. whenever Stefan steps in, you are going to make some heavy
    stuff. Just listen to our session 28, from January 2007. Wow.. we rocked pretty
    hard out into space.. and he laid down some fat riffs for sure. He has his own
    new band project that he is starting up called SumoSun. Some of the guys from
    the OSC will play in this new band. </p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#12 Can you see your music developing down a particular path, becoming more
      heavy, or more New Age (please don&#8217;t!), or more funk/jazz/reggae/whatever?
      <br>
      Or will the large core membership of the band steer you in a steady direction?
      To what extent do you find yourselves influenced by trends in the space/psych
      scene, and do you find yourselves influenced by that as musicians?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: We just go with the flow. I think with different people coming in on
    guitars (Tobias from the Carpet Knights and Stefan from Gas Giant), this changes
    our sound in a good way. It forces people to play into what they do, as they
    are quite different players from Magnus (Mantric Muse) and Sebastian (Bland
    Bladen), but all great guitarists. All very creative. I think for 2007, you
    will see us make more heavy stuff but we will still make the spaced out ambient
    stuff as well, as this is what stoned people do&#8230; We will never make yicky
    new age music. I simply hate the new age synthesizer sound, ugh&#8230; it will
    always be spacey. As far as trends in music go, they don&#8217;t effect us at
    all. We never actually discuss what kind of music we will play. IT never comes
    up. We just set up and play&#8230;</p>
  <p><em>#13 I guess your third album is now in the pipeline&#8230; Can you tell
      us what to expect? Label? Have you considered vinyl, or is the vinyl format
      just too short and expensive?</em></p>
  <p>Scott: Yes.. our 3rd record is being mixed right now by Henrik Udd (Dimmu Borgir,
    First Band from Outer Space). We have about 2hrs of stuff but are only going
    to release a single CD, with 3 tracks, one is 40 minutes long! This will be
    released on Transubstans in May 2007. The extra material we will probably release
    on a volume of Picks from Space, possibly on the Sulatron Label, who would like
    to do a release with us. </p>
  <p>We would really like to get our releases out on vinyl though and this might
    require hooking up with another label, as Transubstans does not have any experience
    with making and promoting vinyl.. not that Johnny does not like vinyl, but as
    a business man, it is expensive and you must know there is a market to sell
    it to make it worthwhile for the band and the label. I love vinyl records and
    still by them and play them today. I would love to see our stuff on a gatefold
    vinyl with killer artwork, a poster, and some unreleased tracks&#8230;. It will
    happen one day&#8230; </p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#14 &#8220;Its All About Delay&#8221; came in a DVD case&#8230; To what
      extent was this due to the desire to have a better-packaged product? Did you
      have the wish to see a more visually attractive cover, and therefore go for
      the DVD case option? <br>
      Have you dreams of massive UA-era Hawkwind style fold out covers, and fat booklets
      containing artwork, and far out literature? Or is this just too much a result
      of burned-out acid-fried minds on a sci-fi trip?!!</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: Ed Unitsky (www.edunitsky.com), the artist asked if it might be possible
    to do a larger scale packaging, such as a DVD for our next release, which we
    had agreed for him to do the artwork, so that is how it happened. I also think
    that the packaging is fantastic and really catches your eye.. IT is too bad
    it is only sold on line for the most part as if you see it in a store, you would
    for sure want to see what the hell is this?? I do dream of putting out fantastic
    gatefold record with posters, stories, etc.. We are surrounded by really creative
    people who write cool poetry, make amazing artwork and of course the musicians.
    IT should all be put together for sure. I also hope that one day we can start
    finding the right computer graphic artists to put together our music to go together
    with each of our tracks and we can release some of our music on DVD audio in
    surround 5.1 mix with totally tripped out images!</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#15 Well, talking of burned-out, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll leave off.
      My mind has been cooked listening to your music while putting this interview
      together, time to listen to a bit of crusty punk to kick me up my sedated ass!!
      Any last words, poems, riffs or savage lysergic marshmallow blows to deliver
      to our readers?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Scott: Thanks to everyone who contributes to our music by buying something
    by us. We will continue to pour out the music, the only way we can and hope
    you can stay hungry enough to consume it all. We will play concerts in Denmark,
    Sweden, Finland and Germany this year. Perhaps, 2008 will bring us to the USA,
    Japan, United Kingdom and Holland among other places&#8230; Keep rocking in
    space..</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>#16 Thank you Scott for taking the time to indulge our minds with your words
      and magical mind-music! Next time a herbal butt comes my way I&#8217;ll be reaching
      for the Oresund disc, that&#8217;s for sure!</em>
