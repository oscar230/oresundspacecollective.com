  <p><strong>Oresund Space Collective - Sleeping With The Sunworm <br>
      (Space Rock Productions 004, Summer 2011)<br>
    </strong><br>
    &quot;Sleeping With The Sunworm&quot; is OSC's 10th official release, a limited
    edition of 500 copies worldwide, recorded at the same sessions that brought
    us &quot;Slip Into The Vortex&quot; and &quot;Dead Man In Space&quot;. 56 minutes
    in length, the album comprises one long spacerock jam, divided up into three
    segments of unequal length solely for ease of play. Part one opens with one
    of bassist Jocke's hypnotic loops, overlayed with guitars that simultaneously
    drone and slice through the mix, and plenty of those patented hissing, whooshing
    synth noises. In a rare move for OSC, small sections of this lengthy track were
    overdubbed, due to equipment problems, but the &quot;live in the studio&quot;
    sound is as convincing as ever. OSC works best as a groove machine, eschewing
    chord progressions and melodic structures in favour of ever-changing bass and
    drum patterns, which rise and fall with tidal frequency, and telepathic co-ordination
    between the musicians. Part two (into which part one seamlessly flows), features
    soaring &quot;classic-rock&quot; guitar soloing, while the mid-section of part
    three breaks down into a very sparse echoing passage, before the rhythm section
    locks back into another uptempo groove, that all ends rather suddenly; even
    at just under an hour you can't help but wish they would just keep playing for
    a while longer. Throughout, the musicians are so note-perfect that it is hard
    to believe these are really improvised pieces. Ten albums on, and without the
    limitations of separated track time, &quot;Sleeping With The Sunworm&quot; is
    OSC's most cohesive offering yet, and a great entry point into their rapidly
    growing back catalogue. <br>

  <p>Dead Man in Space</p>
  <p>Live at Roadburn </p>
  <p>Sleeping with the Sunworm</p>
  <p>Space Rock Productions</p>
  <p>&#8220;We are Oresund Space Collective and we play totally improvised space
    rock&#8221;. </p>
  <p>Oresund Space Collective is a pure space-rock band with members from Denmark
    and Sweden. Their first album was released back in 2006! Dead Man in Space was
    released in January of 2010, in 300 vinyl copies. The cd release I hold has
    a new remix of the album plus the unreleased who tripped on the c(h)ord? High
    pilots is the opener song of the cd, 32:30 long (11 min longer than vinyl release),
    a total trippy song that brings in mind Spacious Mind. It is an incredible track
    that gonna make you run to buy a pair of headphones and melt all your brain
    cells! Additionally who tripped on the c(h)ord? flashes psychedelic slides inside
    us!! GREAT! Also space jazz jam mixes perfectly psych with space and jazz. Plus,
    dead man in space is a space freak out song full of synth and vocals. Live at
    Roadburn is a 2XLP (only 500 copies) recorded live album at Roadburn festival
    2010. Has 5 long tracks: roadburn jam (20.51), reintroduce the snakes to ireland-Volcanoes
    and ash (22.10), global freakout in tilburg (16.19), farvel (15.09)! Travel
    on with space rock jamming, leading synths and guitar plus scattered dub elements!
    Sleeping with the Sunworm (digipack 500 copies) is a 56 min track divided in
    three parts. The first part is relaxing, quite psychedelic, longs 12 min. In
    the other two parts, Oresund Space Collective using endless jamming with guitar
    solo and synth, push their musical spacecraft outside universe. Very good!!!</p>

    &Auml;nnu en platta ( tionde) fr&aring;n det band som jag, bredvid First Band
    From Outer Space, h&aring;ller h&ouml;gst av alla spacerockband i v&auml;rlden.
    Har skrivit om dem f&ouml;rut men f&ouml;r icke invigda b&ouml;r det upprepas
    att &Ouml;SC enbart g&ouml;r improviserad instrumental musik. Skivorna kan till
    en b&ouml;rjan verka monotona och lika men blir allt annat &auml;n detta n&auml;r
    man s&auml;tter sig in i musiken.
  </p>
  <p>&#8221;Sleeping&#8230;&#8221; &auml;r ett enda l&aring;ngt verk p&aring; 56
    minuter. F&ouml;r att g&ouml;ra plattan mer lyssnarv&auml;nlig har man dock
    valt att dela upp l&aring;ten i tre sp&aring;r. Det b&ouml;rjar lugnt och kanske
    aningen utdraget med en tamburin som grund. Men efter ca halva part 1 tar det
    sig och byggs upp p&aring; ett s&auml;tt som gruppen &auml;r m&auml;stare p&aring;.
    Det blir alltmer intensivt och nyanserat och ja, l&aring;ten blir b&auml;ttre
    hela tiden. Och &auml;ven om hela bandet &auml;r mycket bra s&aring; vill jag
    ge ett extra pluss till gitarristerna Magnus och Stefan. Trots allt &auml;r
    det oftast gitarren som dominerar och det kr&auml;ver sin man att h&aring;lla
    intresset och drivet i &ouml;ver en timme!</p>
  <p>M&aring;ste bara till&auml;gga att min f&ouml;rsta lyssning var i h&ouml;rlurar
    liggandes i en solstol. Nu &auml;r visserligen undertecknad en psykedelisk konstn&auml;rstok
    fr&aring;n b&ouml;rjan men oj vad h&auml;ftigt det var. Man lyfter verkligen
    iv&auml;g till andra v&auml;rldar. Mer organisk &auml;n s&aring; h&auml;r blir
    musik inte.</p>
  <p>&#8221;Sleeping&#8230;&#8221; kan rekommenderas &aring; det starkaste!</p>

  <p><strong>&Oslash;resund Space Collective: Sleeping with the Sunworm <br>
      Space Rock Productions (SRP 004)</strong></p>
  <p> The Danish-Swedish psychedelic and instrumental improvisation collective OSC
    has now their own record label Space Rock Productions to help putting out their
    albums. I wish good luck and lots of success for the label! Within a few months
    they have released there albums one of which is a double vinyl.</p>
  <p>Recorded at the same sessions in 2008 that gave us Dead Man in Space and Slip
    into the Vortex, Sleeping with the Sunworm includes 55 minutes of previously
    unissued studio improvisation. The CD has just space rock jam &#8221;Sleeping
    with the Sunworm&#8221; that has been divided into three tracks. This is the
    first time that the band had to use some overdubs since Mogens replaced one
    synth track because it was out of tune and also the band&#8217;s guitar player
    Magnus re-recorded one of his guitar sections. Other than that, all we hear
    is what they played and recorded in one take and totally spontaneously. The
    first part is quite slow but heavy, atmospheric and spacey going including some
    amazing delay guitar, for example. When we&#8217;re a couple of minutes into
    the second part the jam starts to get faster in a nice way and the mood gets
    more positive and you feel like dancing to this. Soon they speed fast in the
    space rock style which goes on for a while. In the last part the band takes
    a bit easier again and the going gets more relaxed but just as psychedelic and
    spacey. Brilliant! It&#8217;s quite rare that a jam this long works so well
    for the whole duration but these guys surely are masters of improvisation. This
    album includes amazing, soaring keyboard stuff, imaginative and skillful guitar
    playing, mind-expanding space sounds as well as a very groovy and hypnotic rhythm
    section. This is another killer album that will be released next month as a
    CD digipak limited to 500 copies. You can buy these albums for example from
    Record Heaven who is their distributor. There are also three new vinyl releases
    coming out on Swedish Kommun 2 label...</p>

    Man skal v&aelig;re en t&aring;lmodig person for &aring; hanskes med &Oslash;SC.
    Traurige jammer som virkelig aldri tar slutt kan gj&oslash;re selv sindige nordmenn
    krakilske. Jeg er fullt klar over at det er folk som liker dette, og &aelig;re
    v&aelig;re dem for det, men for undertegnede er livet for kort til &aring; brukes
    p&aring; timelange liringer uten klart m&aring;l og mening over &eacute;n, eller
    i beste fall to akkorder. Det er ingen utvikling &aring; spore i jammingene,
    ingen oppbygging, ingen dramaturgi, bare endel&oslash;se repetisjoner.</p>

    Sleeping With The Sunworm</p>
  <p>Als bereits zehnten Release folgt &quot;Sleeping With The Sunworm&quot;. Keine
    Ahnung, welchen Fantasien die Musiker hier freien Lauf gelassen haben. Eine
    unruhige, erm&uuml;dende Nacht neben einem schnarchenden, pupsenden Sonnenwurm?
    Eher nicht, so wie sich das Klangwerk stetig aufbaut und an Intensit&auml;t
    immer mehr zunimmt, denkt man doch eher an einen feurigen, sich aufb&auml;umenden
    Sonnenwurm im orgiastischen Liebesrausch. Wenn dies das letzte war, was der
    von uns gegangene Astronaut erlebt hat, na dann herzlichen Gl&uuml;ckwunsch.
    Auch hier leben sich die Musiker wieder voll aus, wie gut sie sich musikalisch
    mittlerweile kennen und wie sehr man zusammengewachsen ist, das klingt schnell
    durch. Mit dem zweiten Teil wird man auch mal etwas fordernder, energischer.
    Hier kann sich auch mal die Gitarre richtig ausleben, die im spacigen Gesamtbild
    sonst oft etwas zur&uuml;ckhaltender agiert. Unvermeidbar bei so einer ausufernden
    Jam ist, dass man sich mal in den Klangwelten verliert und rausfliegt, gern
    auch mal die Gitarre. Aber das &Oslash;RESUND SPACE COLLECTIVE beherrscht die
    Kunst, &uuml;ber elegante Umwege wieder zueinander zu finden. So beruhigen sich
    zum Ende hin Gem&uuml;t und Hormone und man kommt langsam zur Ruhe. Hat man
    die Nacht mit dem Sonnenwurm unter dem Kopfh&ouml;rer genossen, dann f&uuml;hlt
    man sich ob der musikalischen Eindr&uuml;cke, als w&auml;re man selber bei diesem
    Akt dabei gewesen, gro&szlig;artig! Auch &quot;Sleeping With The Sunworm&quot;
    ist auf 500 CDs limitiert, die &quot;Dead Man In Space&quot;-CD auf 1000 St&uuml;ck.

  <p><br>
    Are you up for a fifty-five minute jam session? If the answer is yes, look no
    further than the 10th release from &Oslash;resund Space Collective Sleeping
    with the Sunworm. The album was recorded in 2008; the same sessions that led
    to the albums Dead Man in Space and Slip into the Vortex. On this album Kaufmann
    (drums, percussion) takes the place of Anders K. who played on Dead Man in Space.
    Most of the band hails from Copenhagen, Denmark and the Malm&ouml;, Sweden area.
  </p>
  <p><br>
    There is no sense reviewing individual tracks as such as this is really one
    long song that has been separated into three tracks for conventional purposes.
    It really does play as one song as each part runs into the next section seamlessly
    although there is variety here and I never felt myself becoming uninterested
    while listening. </p>
  <p>As the band name suggests, they play space rock and do a very good job within
    the genre. Lots of sound effects and a variety of synths are used and the guitar
    playing is excellent throughout as it runs the gamut from spacey atmospheric
    soloing to more psychedelic tones. I like how the band blends mellow atmospheric
    sections with more intense, heavier sounds. </p>
  <p>Those of you who appreciate improvisational jamming and space/psychedelic rock,
    Sleeping with the Sunworm is a no-brainer. We can thank bands like &Oslash;resund
    Space Collective for keeping space rock alive and well in this day and age of
    mindless pop drivel from the latest flavour of the month. Thanks guys&#8230;

  <p><strong>&Oslash;resund Space Collective- Sleeping with the Sunworm</strong></p>
  <p>Review by Gary Hill<br>
    &Oslash;resund Space Collective&#8217;s form of space rock is always improvised.
    That means the music at times wanders along the lines of jam music. Of course,
    much space rock and jam band sounds aren&#8217;t that far removed. This particular
    release is split into the three separate tracks, but really it&#8217;s all linked
    together and all titles are the same, just with the part (1, 2 or 3) added to
    the end. For that reason, I&#8217;d say you could look at this as one long track.
    It&#8217;s a slowly moving beast, but that&#8217;s typical of the genre. Of
    course, comparisons to Hawkwind are appropriate, but this music goes in other
    directions, too. This might be my favorite release from OSC, and that says a
    lot. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Track by Track Review </strong><br>
    <br>
    Sleeping With The Sunworm Pt. 1<br>
    Rising up gradually, keyboards and a driving bass dominate the early portions
    of this piece. It slowly becomes more hard rocking and waves of Hawkwind like
    sounds are heard over the top. There are some serious science fiction oriented
    moments as this continues to build. Then, around the five minute mark or so,
    it drops down a bit to something resembling the early era of Hawkwind. By about
    the ten minute mark it&#8217;s morphed into almost a Hendrix meets space rock
    kind of jam with some noisy, psychedelically inspired guitar soloing. This eventually
    glides straight into the next number.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Sleeping With The Sunworm Pt .2<br>
    Coming out of the previous tune, after a time this shifts to a more energized
    jam that&#8217;s less Hawkwind-like (although it still contains plenty of space
    rock) and closer to some more mainstream progressive rock. Although, there are
    also some hints of bands like The Grateful Dead and The Allman Brothers to be
    found. As this continues it almost becomes jazz-like in some ways. By around
    the eight minute mark the harder rocking elements have started to dominate.
    A psychedelically inspired guitar solo soars over the beast at around the ten
    and a half minute mark. Within the next couple minutes the piece has moved out
    to more purely space music with keyboard sounds holding more sway over the arrangement.
    Before it hits the fourteen and a half minute mark it&#8217;s definitely become
    a mellower arrangement. It builds out to a harder rocking jam later that&#8217;s
    more along the lines of a space rock version of Emerson Lake and Palmer. In
    fact, but around the eighteen minute mark it&#8217;s seriously jamming. It works
    straight out into the next piece. <br>
    <br>
    Sleeping With The Sunworm Pt .3
  </p>
  <p>Fiery, hard rocking space music with some fusion built in creates the concept
    as this comes out of the previous piece. It modulates downward a bit with keyboards
    driving it in an almost Tangerine Dream goes Hawkwind sound. Around the one
    minute mark, though, it drops to a very stripped back arrangement. Waves of
    space build on top as this continues to surge forward. By around the five and
    a half minute mark it slows drastically into an almost space rock goes blues
    approach that&#8217;s killer. As they continue to rework the number it works
    closer to a psychedelic jam band sort of element. Some hot guitar soloing occurs
    before the ten minute mark. Then it drops way down to a stripped down, extremely
    slow moving arrangement to continue. A more energized drum beat comes up around
    the ten and a half minute mark and some rather Doors-like keyboards are heard
    as the band begin to ramp things back up. Some cool guitar soloing is heard
    as this continues. The pace continues to rise and by the thirteen minute mark
    it&#8217;s crossed into near fusion as the guitar continues to scream overtop.
    It works to more hard rock sounds from there. The space elements start to dominate
    again by the fourteen and a half minute mark. Within a minute it&#8217;s modulate
    to some mellower space weirdness that&#8217;s quite a bit like Hawkwind. Percussion
    drives hard around the sixteen and a half minute mark with waves of keyboard
    washing over the top. A cool space groove has taken over within the next minute
    or so. It continues evolving gradually, but by the twenty two minute mark a
    pulsing sort of space rock has taken over. That leads to the outro. <br>
