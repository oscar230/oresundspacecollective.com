  <p><strong>TROTS AND BONNIE</strong></p>
  <p>Recorded at La Noria Studios, Riogordo, Spain July.- August 2009</p>
  <p>"A while ago I contacted legendary underground cartoonist Shary Flenniken
    and rather cheekily asked her if she could do some CD artwork for me.Amazingly
    she said yes and sent me the cover art for Trots and Bonnie.How cool is that?<br>
    I have to say that was the easy part compared to finding the time and energy
    to record the music.Trots and Bonnie was recorded over the space of two months
    inbetween visiting family and having house guests.<br>
    When I am unsure of what to record I sometimes go back to earlier themes or
    tracks I have played before.That's why there are two versions of Pan African
    Glider Flight here..one acoustic,one electric.<br>
    Joe Meek's Cat started as a joke..i was trying to record something that would'nt
    have sounded out of place at Meek's Holloway road studio circa 1964.<br>
    Shingle Monster is kind of a creepy soundtrack to a short imaginary movie featuring
    waterproof robots on a beach!"</p>
