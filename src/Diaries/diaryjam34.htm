    <font size="3">20:45 Swedes (Tobias, Jocke and Luz) all arrive at my place.
      I have my gear out on the street waiting to go. Van is even smaller than the
      lat one we had, so there is no way we will be able to bring all our gear. Everyone
      is in a great mood. We drive out to the Mantric Muse rehearsal room to pick
      up the Danes (PIB, Magnus, Mogens). IT takes us about 45 minutes to pack up
      the van and another 5 or 10 for them to smoke before we can leave. Mogens had
      to leave his mixer behind, pib wanted to take his drum kit (no way) and both
      of Magnus's guitar cabinets. We for sure need the bigger version of this van
      next time. </font>

  <p>21:45 We are finally off to drive to Rødby to catch the Puttgarden ferry.
    It would have been faster to go with the Gedser- Rostock ferry but the last
    one was at 21 and we could not get the car before 20:00. </p>
  <p>23:45 We missed the 23:15 ferry that we were booked on but no big deal as there
    was hardly any cars on this one. People are happy. Magnus buys a case of beer
    and everyone is drinking coffee (the ones who have to drive). We have about
    550km to go..</p>
  <p>2:24 We change drivers now. Tobias has been driving the whole way. Magnus will
    now drive. We are 100km from Berlin now, I am guessing. I will try to get a
    bit of sleep. </p>
  <p>7:00 We are about 100km from Plauen. Turns out Magnus missed the Potsdam trun
    off the E10/E55 down to E9, so we ended up driving all the way around Berlin
    (the whole ring), about an extra 150km! We are at a gas station south of Leipzeig.
    People are smoking a joint. Magnus will drive the rest of the way. He is pretty
    fresh. I have not slept at all really. Luz, Jocke, tobias, Mogens have been
    sleeping. Pib can't sleep either but is wired. The music we have been listening
    to is: Sula Bassana- Dreamer, Ozric Tentacles- Live Underslunky, Widespread
    Panic- Best of, Heru Avenger, Frank Marino- Live, Anitbalas- Security, Ole Lukkøye-
    Doo Doo Doo..</p>

  <p>8:30 We arrive pretty exhausted at the Malzhaus in Plauen. Really cool town.
    People are sleeping all over the place in tents, sleeping bags on the outdoor
    stage, campers, etc.. A few people are up and about. We meet Gerd, the organizer
    and he is super cool. The venue is amazing. IT is a buliding from like the 14th
    century. They used to store the Malt here for making beer. The whole inside
    of the venue is decorated with Grateful Dead stuff and tie die. Nice...</p>

  <p>9:45 We ate a really nice big breakfast that they provide everyday and then
    we follow Gerd to Pension, the bed and breakfast place about 5km away that we
    will stay at, run by a really cool German lady named Annelisse. The place is
    covered with pictures and posters of all the bands for the last 15 years that
    have stayed at her place. We crash out now. </p>

  <p>14:30 I woke up with sun roasting my body..totally dehydrated. I guess I slept
    about 3½ hrs. Beautiful day. We need to be at the venue at 17 to talk
    to the other band about the gear we can use and to set up for the soundcheck.
    I share a small room with Magnus, tobias and jocke are in the other small room
    and Luz, pib and Mogens sleep in the large room with the couch, table, fridge
    and coffee maker. I know I will be very tired later.. Red bull.... Look forward
    to seeing my friend Dave (Sula Bassana) who will play with us both days. I feel
    in some kind of daze after missing a whole night of sleep. HOpe I manage later..
  </p>
  <p>15:40 I just took a shower and everyone is starting to come back to life. Magnus
    is downstairs talking with Anne lisse. We will got to the venue at 17.</p>
  <p>17:00 We arrive at the venue. Some people milling about. They have this far
    out Guillotine near the club and some local drunks are hanging out.</p>

  </p>
  <p>20:40 We had a really nice Gulasch dinner with some really strange (but yummy)
    sponge potatoes with a small piece of bread inside. Everyone is having some
    beers and in a good mood. SOld a few CDs already. Soundcheck took a really long
    time so Jawbone, the Hamburg bluegrass-country band will not be able to start
    as planned. We were to start at 23:00 but will go on later. We had a lot of
    trouble getting any sound out of the monitors the way we wanted. Seems ok now..
    but you never know until you really start to play. </p>
  <p>23:16 Jawbone are still playing. THey played about 25 songs and for nearly
    2hrs. Pretty cool band. Really nice banjo-lapsteel player. Stand up bass, acoustic
    guitar.. 4 piece band. A pretty decent crowd in the place now. I am totally
    blown away by how cheap beer is.. only 1€ for a half liter of really good
    beer. All the drinks are very cheap. Everyone in the band is pscyhed to play
    now and smoking a joint and no one has had too many beers. People are drinking
    a lot of cola. A local cola. </p>

  <p>1:30 We played about a 75 minute set with some really cool stuff in it. It
    is really loud on the stage and those red lights when they turn them on it is
    like heat lamp for a lizard blasting you. People were really dancing and we
    got a nice response. I guess there are around 100 people... We take a short
    break for a beer and joint...</p>
  <p>3:30 Wow.. what a 2nd set.. That was totally amazing stuff. This set was about
    90mins. The first jam was great. PIB, wow..what a great drummer. I think everyone
    is playing at a very high standard and having a great time. It is so nice to
    see the audience dancing and smiling and they really show their appreciation
    when you stop between the songs.. Great crowd. one of the best we have ever
    played to in many ways.. I am very tired and pack down the merchandise until
    tomorrow. I hope the recordings are good. They have also made a soudnboard recording
    via a submixer so they can get a more balanced sound. It will be interesting
    to hear as Magnus and Dave were playing completely blinded, not being able to
    hear anything that the other was playing as they were on the opposite sides
    of the stage and there was no guitar in the monitors, only synthesizer.</p>
  <p>4:15 We are back and going to sleep. Some people stay up for a bit and have
    another joint and beer. </p>
