  <p>16:30 I am sitting outside in the great weather waiting for Magnus to pick
    me up in his Volvo. He is getting Stefan and Mogens and their gear first and
    will get me last as I am on the way to the bridge to Sweden. We ahve borrowed
    my friend Michael's BroBizz, so going over the bridge is half price. Thanks
    Michael. I think it will be an interesting gig tonight with all these people
    we have not played that much with. I am still a little bummed out that we could
    not do the multitrack recording. We only have a door deal and will get 50kr
    for each paid person and one beer each at the bar and no food. That is Sweden
    for you. I hope at least 50 people show up..</p>

    gear </p>
  <p>17:00 We are suppose to be in Malmö at 18. Still no one. IT is normal
    for everyone to run late but it does put some stress on things and it is always
    easier if you have more time to set up and relax and not have to rush and set
    up. We see how it goes.. Quite a few people asking me what I am doing and I
    give someof them our flyers. I could probably sell alot of CDs just out the
    window as lots of people walk by here everyday on the way to the metro and the
    beach...</p>
  <p>19:00 We are setting up now. Kaufmann was suppose to come at 16:30 and get
    his drum set up and he was not even there when we arrived at 18:10! He and Par
    had trouble getting a cab to bring the gear so they arrive at 18:30 or so. IT
    would have saved us a lot of time if he got here early but that is the way it
    goes. Kaufmann is almost always late but he is a great drummer so it is worth
    the wait! The stage is going to be very crowded. With three guitar sets ups
    and violin and 5 synthesizers. Looks really cool with all this gear. Luz would
    have had to be out on the floor and what we would have done for microphones
    I have not idea as their shitty 16 track mixer only has 13 working channels...

  <p>19:33 We had a few beers and a chat about how it should work and we agreed
    that having 3 guitars at once was too much so all the guitar players will shift
    around but we will start with Stefan and Tobias, our main men.. </p>
  <p>21.30 Soundcheck took a long time and we just got back from having some Indian
    food at a really cheap takeway place. Magnus and I had the vindeloo and Mogens
    and Stefan had the 3 course vegetarina one. Not sure what Kaufmann ordered.
    Very few people here. I guess like 15. We will start in 15 mins anyway. We want
    to play as much as possible. </p>

    Soundcheck</p>
  <p>11:15 The first set was amazing! We played 83 minutes and only 3 pieces of
    music. I dedicated the concert to Albert Hoffman, who died last week. Stefan
    was playing some really melodic and mindblowing guitar. Tobias played a few
    amazing solos as well. Par played the bass on this first set. Micke and Suzzane
    join in after the 2nd jam and play the very long 3rd one. Tobias takes a break.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Set I 82 mins</strong></p>
  <p>Albert Hoffman's Last Trip 33:32, Planet LSD25-746321 24:31, Band Introductions
    00:50, Floating in Utopia 23:56</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>00:55 We played a really cool 2nd set as well. It had quite a different vibe
    and Mats played a really cool sitar guitar to start things off. Jocke was on
    the bass and Tobias started. Stefan, Micke and Suzzane will join after this
    first jam. I started the 2nd set off doing a spoken word piece. The Wizard blew
    ihs Horn. It did not work out that well. I think my vocal delivery was just
    to dry and boring. Oh well. I announced to the audience, (which was filling
    up the place now as it was going full blown reggae the second we stop playing
    and people could come in for free after midnight) that we would play a reggae
    dub thing but in the end we played something totally different, maybe the last
    few bars were dub like. The band totally blew me off. That was cool.... Great
    concert. We only sold 3 CDs and one DVD and there were only 26 paid people in
    the end. Pity.. they missed out on a great show. It surprises me that the 8
    Swedish people who played tonight that are in 5 differnt bands that few of their
    fellow band mates and none of their friends or family come out to see them play...
    IT is not like they play all the time. IT is quite rare to see them play live.
    I don't get it...</p>
  <p>I had a great time and think we played a killer show.. The lighting was cool
    and the sound seemed good. I think that both Stefan and Tobias are too low on
    the recording though. A few problems with the recording as well so I am glad
    that Stojs also recorded.</p>
  <p><strong>Set II 70:58</strong></p>
  <p>The Wizard blew his Horn 2:51, Indian Space Voyage 19:21, Forest Mysteries
    30:17, Dub Imposter 18:28</p>
