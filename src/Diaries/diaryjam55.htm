    <font size="4"><strong>Session 55- Swamp Room Mania, Kafe Kult, Munich, Germany
        9/19/09</strong></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">8:29 We are on the road about 30 mins behind schedule but I
      think we will manage. We have 850km to Munich from Leuven and you never know
      about the traffic and roadwork in Germany! We are listening to MAGMA now. I
      just got the 12 CD box set of all their first records and it is totally amazing.
      Wow... PIB is in a very bad mood. He should not drink. PIB and alcohol do not
      mix well. I am glad he does not drink before he plays or it would be a disaster..
      We had a very short breakfast and had to get out the door. Mogens was impossible
      to get up but we managed. Teh van is very quiet this morning as people did not
      go to bed before 3 or so. I bought the Count Raven CD High on Infinity last
      night, it was the only one besides the new one I did not own and I love that
      record. Luck for us not a lot of people on the hgihway.</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">10:00 We are just passing through Köln now and seem to
      be making good time. Pär is driving. Nick and I have been watching the
      Hitchhikers Guide to the Galazy DVD on his computer. It is hard to hear the
      words very clearly. What a cool film. I really want to see this all the way
      through. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">10:48 We have stopped to get gas and are about 100km from Frankfurt
      now. Some of the guys are smoking a joint now. I can tell people are a bit tired
      and maybe hungover. We are only listening to music quite low as PIB was complaining
      loudly earlier. I will need it louder when I drive.</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">11:31 Sign just said 450km to Munchen! There is a lot more traffic
      on the road now but we are making good time, We are listening to Tallivastian
      Presidenti- an CD from 1972! Great stuff. PIB, our drummer actually played two
      gigs with the guitarist, Jukka Tollinen some years back. Cool. I have a feeling
      that the band, perhaps any band, would have a hard time if this lasted a week
      or more, with all the driving, small van, drinking and smoking too much, not
      enough sleep ever, etc... It takes it's toll on you. I don't drink much at all
      so this helps as I never had a hangover as we rarely get more than 5-6 hrs sleep
      a night. IT is ok for the others who can sleep in the van or anywhere and get
      3-4 more hrs during the day to catch up but I can't do that. I don't sleep at
      all in cars or planes. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">14:44 160km to Munchen now. I really want to see my friends
      in Phased. We are listning to Antibalas- 1st CD (liberation Time), and also
      heard Korai ôröm-2000. Both cool stuff. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">17:00 We have arrived and all is cool. Chris from Phased saved
      a merch place right next to them for us. What a very cool place this is. Been
      Obscene, a Colour Haze inspired band is first. Met up with Marco (he will do
      lights for us), Walter (Roadburn), Colour Haze guys, Phased guys, etc... Mühler
      is here also. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">18:05 Phased played a great show. Room was only about 1/3 full
      for them. It is very warm here and most people are outside now and the big room
      is an oven! </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">20:24 I had some food and COlour Haze have just finished Orwo6
      us now on and they are pretty cool, like a harder version of Rotor. The Rotor
      guitarist plays the drums in this band. The place is very warm inside. The whole
      band is in a good mood. I am checking out a bit of most bands but most of the
      guys are just hanging outside. I go back adn forth to the merch table and hang
      there and talk with people, sell some stuff, etc... We are on at 22. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">23:15 Wow.. what a great gig. We blew the place to bits. They
      really liked us a lot. Pity we only got to play like 50 mins. We had a great
      sound on the stage and a great feeling. Mangus played some monster guitar riffs,
      I hope you can hear him on the recording. I have a feeling the drums will be
      too loud like at both other shows. Fucking sound men! Room was pretty packed
      and people really liked it. One guy kept yelling 7 Trumpets.... I had no clue
      what he meant. He later told me it was a song from Aphroditie's child-666 record.

  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">01:00 I did not see Truckfighters or Rotor in the big room.
      I really liked Samsara Blues Experiment a lot. A lot of acid jamming guitar
      solos. Christian is great. The Devil's Horms killed the Matador was super cool
      stuff as well. Vaudville meets beefheart meets Bonzo Dog Band. Young kids as
      well. I had a long talk with Walter from Roadburn. Such an amazing guy. SO dedicated.
      The Dutch band, The Machine were also really great. Wow... Magnus and Mogens
      really liked them. They have a new record out on Nasoni. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">03:45 Totally exhausted. I had to drive after the gig and then
      park the car like 2km away and walk back to the apartment before sleeping and
      deal with PIB, who had too much to drink and was being an asshole about things.
      He forgot his drum stool that he loaned to a couple of bands. It is his fault,
      not mine. We will have to make a detour and go get it tomorrow, if it is still
      there. </font>
