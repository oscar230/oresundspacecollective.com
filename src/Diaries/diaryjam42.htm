  <p>15:00 Keith Henderson, Chris (my nephew) and I took my car out on the friday
    with my gear and the hard disc recorder,. It took about 2hrs because of some
    traffic jam due to road construction to go the 140km) but we had no problem
    finding the place and arrived in time to set up the Hard disc recorder and our
    tents before the first band started at 18:00. The weather was really nice and
    about 200 people were there in total including all the bands. The rest of the
    OSC was arriving a bit later this evening. </p>

  <p>21:45 The rest of the OSC crew arrives and they are already pretty high and
    happy and it a great mood. WE have a really fun time on this night and see a
    wide range of music but the soundman really needs some help and they need to
    leave more time between bands and get the bands to stick more to the time as
    the night ended up going 3&frac12; hrs over schedule and poor Causa Sui did
    not get to start playing until 3:45 in the morning (we would be in almost the
    same position the next night!). I only saw 1-2 songs (Luz from the OSC joined
    them) and had to go lay down as I was stll tired and suffering from jetlag from
    just arriving back from the USA the day before. Phew.. I heard their whole concert
    and it was awesome! For sure the best band of the first day. Such a great band.

  <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
  <p>Slept maybe 3-4 hours at the most and was pretty damn tired but I had to get
    up and help with the Hard Disc recorder as Village Idiot would start at 13:00.
    They started 13:20, which was a bad sign as they were 3&frac12; hrs late yesterday
    with only 6 bands and today there are 10 bands. Will we play at 6 in the morning
    to like 5 people? Well, not quite, we started playing at 3:30 in the monring
    and had a great show. I guess we played for about 35 people who were really
    into it and stayed the whole time and wanted us to keep playing but the soundman
    was falling asleep and really wanted us to stop playing. We played about 1hr
    and 45 mins. Unfortunately there is no audience recording of the show, but we
    do have a great 24 track (actually 15 tracks) recording and there is also a
    direct soundboard out recording which I have no idea what that will sound like.
    It will go up on archive.org. It was a great and really fun time and we will
    play next year for sure on a more well organized day and have the full light
    show! </p>
  <p>I loved this little festival and will try to get a lot more people to come
    to this cool place next year. Amazing location right on the grounds of a brewery
    with excellent ale. NIce time...</p>
