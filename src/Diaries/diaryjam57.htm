  <p>8:00 I am taking the train to Malm&ouml; to go to Hertz to rent the van. It
    is over 1000kr more expensive this time than when we rented in March for the
    same van and the same length of time.. </p>
  <p>8:50 I am at Hertz and the van is getting cleaned now so I have to wait some
    minutes. Everything is in order, also for the rental for gong and playing in
    Wurzburg at the end of November. In general I think things are going well for
    the band. We are slowly building up a dedicated fan base and getting invited
    to play interesting places and festivals like the Psychedelic network and Roadburn.
    We are evolving and creating new music with new musicians all the time. I think
    we are maintaining our high standard of musicianship and still having a good
    time. </p>
  <p>10:18 I am waiting for Mogens and Nick at Dragens Hule. I got to my place about
    9:50 and loaded up all my stuff and had a little more food and out the door.
    Van is more than 1000kr for the same van and the same length of time Thursday
    morning from 9 until Monday morning at 9. Strange&#8230;. It is a really beautiful
    day. The sun is shinning and it a blue sky. Just like in March when we were
    waiting to go! I love going to Finland. It is a long trip but we hear a lot
    of good music, have a nice time with each other, etc and the crowds really appreciate
    our music. </p>
  <p>13:00 We are having a break on the side of the road. The colors of the trees
    are amazing right now in Sweden, Fantastic. Sebastian called and he wants to
    meet at 15:30 in Mj&ouml;lby. Looks like we will have no problem making that
    time. </p>

    Driving by in Sweden... nice colors on the trees..</p>
  <p>15:40 We are in Mj&ouml;lby, which is about 2hrs from Stockholm, where we will
    pick up Mattias and Juba. This is some of the music we have been listening to
    on the trip so far:</p>
  <p>Brant Bjork- Saved by Magic, Pothead- Fairground, Taipuva Lutisuria IV, Dedato
    Siguir (African living in Denmark), Hawkwind- Astounding Sounds Amazing Music,</p>
  <p>17:40 We are getting close to where Matthias&#8217;s rehearsal place is. We
    have heard some of the sitar jams that I recorded with the Siena Root guys and
    everyone thought it was really relaxing and cool music. </p>
  <p>18:40 We have picked up Mattias and his pedal steel and things. We have also
    just met up with Juba and his bass! Now, we just sit in the van and wait in
    the cue at the Viking Line ferry to Turku, Finland. Ferry leaves at 20:10 and
    arrives at 7:45. I really hope we don&#8217;t have big snoring problems, as
    I can&#8217;t sleep with snoring people at all. I also hope the band does not
    stay up all night drinking.. We will see. We are all starving though and will
    go straight for food. </p>
  <p>10:00 We had a really nice meal (duck with risotto for me and Sebastian). Mattias
    and Mogens are vegetarians&#8217; so a lot of times things are limiting for
    them. Neither eats fish or shellfish either. We have had some beers in the bar
    and are hanging out in one of the cabins. I will try to crash soon and hope
    that Juba is not a snoring one. I know that Sebastian does not, so he is in
    my cabin as well.</p>

    </strong></p>
  <p>07:00 I had a pretty bad night. I tried to get a little drunk with 3 beers
    and some salmiaki korskonkorva but it did not work. Juba is a very loud sleeper,
    when he finally did come into the room at like 5. He was hanging out in the
    bar with Christian, the old singer in Terrafirma, now in Lord Vicar, who he
    has know for 20 years. I was not really sleeping much anyway. I just lay there
    and my mind is running and I just can&#8217;t shut it off. Now, I am tired.
    Luckily, Sebastian will drive to Lahti and Juba will drive after the gig tonight!</p>
  <p>8:54 Wow.. I had to take a breathalyzer test when I drove off the ferry. I
    was at 0.32 and the limit is 0.50. I felt totally fine except I was really tired.
    He recommended that we switch drivers to some one how had not been drinking.
    The only one was Mattias as he does not drink but he also does not drive! I
    drove to the first place for breakfast about 10km away and then Sebastian took
    over. We are having breakfast now in Piiki&ouml;. We were listening to the amazing
    Thor&#8217;s Hammer CD from 1971. Great Danish band. It is a beautiful clear
    day in Finland but damn cold, -7C outside. I am totally exhausted. Had a cinnamon
    roll, some tea and juice. </p>
  <p>10:45 We just got done hearing Pothead- Pot of Gold EP. I had not heard that
    in ages. We also heard this EP by a cool new UK band called Paradise 9. Everyone
    thought it was cool. Looks like we will get to Lahti around 12 and Jussi will
    make us some lunch and we can try to sleep a bit in the afternoon.</p>
  <p>12:16 We could not find his house as our map appears to be wrong so he is coming
    to pick us up. We are quite close by. </p>
  <p>12:36.. We are at Jussi&#8217;s house. A really nice place. Jonni and his girlfriend
    Christine are there. Very nice people. They have prepared a smoked salmon (they
    smoked it themselves just now!), vegetarian lasagne, salad, etc&#8230; very
    nice. </p>

    house </p>
  <p>15:46 Now we are in Lahti relaxing before we will head to the venue for Souncheck
    around 18. Torvi, is one of Finland&#8217;s oldest running original rock clubs.
    It is an honor to get to play at this club. Jussi showed us a full page article
    in the local paper about the festival. He thinks that we will have a very good
    crowd for this evening Johnny, the VJ was here when we had lunch. Seemed like
    a really nice person as well. I look forward to play tonight. Everyone is hungry
    to play so this is good. Nick, he is addicted to his guitar and playing any
    chance he gets. He and Juba were having a bass-guitar jam and working some things
    out while I was lying down. Sounded cool. </p>
  <p>19:00 Soundcheck jams are really good and we are going to go get some pizza
    around the corner at a place called Ararat. Recommended by the people in Temples,
    who are really cool. We also have met our drummer for the night Jukka and is
    very nice and seemed to fit in well and click with us right away. </p>
  <p>21:00 The pizza was terrible and we are now in the backstage hanging out with
    the Temples and this is Sirius people. All super cool. People are starting to
    arrive and temples will start at 22. The visuals that Jonni is set up look really
    cool but the projector does not seem strong enough for this venue. The TV sets
    look great though. I hope that a lot of people show up. </p>
  <p>22:25 Temples is playing and they are quite heavy cool. They do a lot of improvising
    the lead guitar player and singer said. They have their structure for the songs
    but then experiment a lot. A decent crowd of 75 or so now I would say. The band
    smoked a joint with them right before they hit the stage. </p>

      width="307" height="230">This
    is Sirius</p>
  <p>23:45 This is Sirius is now playing and this is strange but pretty cool music.
    A bit like Circle meets Bongzilla with a beat poet singer who has a very gravel
    like voice. Singer is very special on stage and music is pretty dynamic. Crowd
    seems to dig them a lot. </p>
  <p>03:00 Wow.. what an amazing gig. Jukka was a killer drummer and we really played
    a very cool concert tonight. I was really blown away. I pray the recording sounds
    good as it was a good show and the people really loved it and thought we were
    amazing. A lot of people came up to us afterwards. I did not sell much stuff.
    I hope someone can send me some pictures as I did not take any of us. Someone
    video taped some of the show. Jukka from Hyvink&auml;&auml; was in the front
    row and loving it but also quite drunk. Temples people were also in the front
    and digging it. I had the best time I have had at a gig in a long time and felt
    really inspired. The pedal steel was amazing and beyond my wildest dreams how
    cool it was. Nick was very tired and did not rip off many killer leads but had
    the groove riffs and hooked in with Juba and the drummer. Juba was also super
    solid and the band liked playing with him. Great night!<br>
