<p><strong><font size="4">Session 30- Hemliga Tr&auml;dg&aring;rden, Stockholm 
  06/04/07</font></strong></p>
<p>This was the start of the first ever OSC tour of Scandinavia, with 3 concerts 
  in 6 days in 3 of the 4 capitals! I picked up the van in Sweden the night before 
  and loaded some of my stuff and picked up Mogens, S&oslash;ren, Michael and 
  Magnus at the Mantric Muse rehearsal space at 8:00. We loaded up the gear and 
  headed off to Malm&ouml; to pick up Luz and his percussion gear. We were only 
  15 minutes behind schedule and people were in a great mood despite most of these 
  guys staying up all the night and only getting like 2-3 hrs of sleep. I got 
  8hrs the night before and was well rested. I have bought a case of coke so we 
  have some sugar and more.. This van is quite small for us and all this gear. 
  We are totally packed and we don't have Luz's stuff or sebastian yet...</p>
<p>The new Abramas Brama live CD was stuck in the CD player from the day before 
  and I was a bit worried we would be without music (or have to hear Abramis Brama 
  over and over) for the trip but luckily, Mogens and Magnus, after nearly taking 
  apart the front section of the car, got the CD out and we had no further problems.. 
  phew..</p>
<p>9:30 We take off from Malm&ouml; and bid Kaufmann goodbye. See you Monday night,late...</p>
<p>11:35 I have been driving and now people need a food and nicotine break (joints 
  as well). We are in Vaggeryds Kommune, some small town. It is only a couple 
  of hours before we will pick up Sebastian in Mj&ouml;lby. </p>
<p>12:08 The 2nd joint is smoked and everyone is happy and had some food and coffee 
  and we will hit the road again. We have been listning to Allman brothers- Hittin' 
  the NOte and the new Titan CD and the new Hidria Spacefolk and the new remixes 
  of Bland Blanden stuff with Luz overdubbed on it. SOunds great...</p>
<p>13:45 We are having trouble getting Seb's Vox amp and space echo and stuff 
  all packed in. Anyway, we are only about 2&frac12; hrs from Stockhplm and making 
  very good time, driving about 140km/hr most of the time. Everyone is happy to 
  see Sebastian and smoke another joint and we hit the road... Listen to some 
  Kingston wall now..</p>
<p>16:30 We arrive at the venue. I call Sam from Siena Root and they will come 
  in 30 minutes. His apartment is 3 minutes walk from the place and it turns out 
  KG lives only 1 min walk more from here as well. It is sunny but really cold 
  here. About 2-3C. This is a strange place and we are wondering if we are playing 
  in this house on the hill or in this outside like summer terrace place with 
  the blue tarp for aroom. Place looks like it will fall off the hill. Sam and 
  the Siena Root people come and find the strange greek guy who runs this place 
  and it turns out we are playing in the terrace place. What a mess! </p>
<p>18:15 Damn it is fucking cold in here. We have moved all the gear in here now 
  and are trying to figure out how to set up. The stage area is way too small 
  so we decide to set up on the floor on the side in the club. People are a bit 
  down to play in this sort of place and who will come here? Turns out we will 
  have to pay for some food and all our drinks. The greek guy will cook the food 
  and charge us like 30kr per plate. This is going to be cold and what if no one 
  comes??? </p>
<p>20:38 We had a short soundcheck, not that good. Drums are very loud in this 
  room. Siena Root are setting up now. We ate some spaghetti with olive sauce 
  (pretty awful stuff...) with bread and salad and feta cheese. Everyone is have 
  a beer as well. Rebrandts gold 3-5% alcohol. We are all freezing in here and 
  decide we have to smoke some joints and sit in the car with the heater on to 
  keep warm...a few people are starting to trickle in... </p>
<p>1:19 Wow... what a night.... A lot of people (like 80 paying people 30kr each) 
  showed up and it turned out to have a really cool atmosphere. Siena Root played 
  a 40 minute set and were great but played really loud. Two neighbors came and 
  complained. This place is a normal neighborhood with lots of apartments really 
  close. THe sound just flies out of this place. Anyway, we set up and started 
  playing soon after and we were amazed at how into it the people who were here 
  were. It gave us a lot of energy but not warmth. Luckily people were fully stoned. 
  We played about 75 mins and need a break as we were really thirsty. Unfortunately, 
  the batteries died and only 45 minutes was recorded of this set. After another 
  joint and a beer, we hurried back to play another 45 minutes and Sam from Siena 
  Root joined us on the bass to give Michael's blisters a rest. That was a really 
  cool jam. We sold a few CDs and talked with a lot of really cool people. One 
  guy bought one of everything from our catalog! Thanks man.. if you read this, 
  please write to me so we can put your name in our next CD!</p>

<p>8:20 I am up early and listening to a bit of the 2nd set. SOund is not that 
  bad but the drums are still the loudest thing by far, except my synth sometimes 
  comes blasting out to fry your brain! I did not sleep well at all on this small 
  but comfortable couch at KH's (guitarist in Siena Root). I feel like I woke 
  up every 30 minutes the whole night. We crashed out around 3:30 after packing 
  down all the gear and putting it in a room under the place where we played.. 
  Ended up being a nice night but I was frozen solid. We are listening to this 
  really great sitar player Niladri Kumar. Really nice stuff to hear on this morning. 
  We had a great breakfast and chatted a lot. KG is a very serious sitar player. 
  I hope he will jam with us one day! </p>
<p>11:00 We meet up with the rest of the people, who all crashed at Sam's place. 
  Some of them were up drinking until like 5, beers and whisky. They look tired, 
  especially Magnus who has a really long face and totally bloodshot eyes... We 
  will all go up for some coffee and food at Tellus, the theater and cafe where 
  Sam and Love (drummer in Siena Root) both work. We hang out and people had a 
  really great time playing. </p>
<p>14:00 We are now all loaded up in the van and people are starting to come back 
  to life again. A nice sunny but cold day today. Our ferry to Helsinki leaves 
  at 16:45 and will arrive the next day at 10 in the morning. Long trip... Should 
  be able to get some rest... We head down to the ship and park the car. Magnus 
  is buying a midi file handler (Yamaha, I think) from a guy who will meet us 
  there. We get the thing and head off into town and get some coffee and go to 
  a cool music shop and just walk around Gammel Stad and come back to the car. 
</p>
<p>16:00 As we are in the line people get a little paranoid when the Customs people 
  come up to the van with a drug dog. He just sniffs all the way around the van 
  and goes away.. Phew...</p>
<p>16:20 We are in our cabins now and people are quite relaxed. We will go for 
  a really nice meal soon.</p>
<p>21:06 We ate at a really nice resteraunt and had a beer. After dinner we just 
  chilled out and had some beers (bought 2 cases at the tax free shop and some 
  Salmiaki Korskenkorva).We sat around and told old stories of our younger drug 
  adventures, just me, sebastian, luz and magnus. Everyone is feeling good after 
  some herb vapor as well. Seb, Magnus and I decide to go take a sauna. </p>
<p>22:30 Sauna was amazing and we are quite relaxed and feeling great. I will 
  crash early to be fresh for Heslinki but I am a bit worried some of these guys 
  will stay up all night and get completely wasted and be useless in Finland.. 
  I hope that I am wrong.. We need to play a great gig...</p>
