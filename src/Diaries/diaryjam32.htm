<p><strong><font size="5">Session 32- Studenterhuset, K&oslash;benhavn April 12th, 
  2007</font></strong></p>
<p>I loaded up my gear and headed off to pick up Stefan and Thomas at the old 
  Gas Giant rehearsal space. Stefan was already there having a few beers when 
  I arrived. He was in a great mood. Thomas called and said he was on his way 
  at 17:22. We hung out and he was here shortly. We had already loaded up the 
  car so we talked about Stefan's new band project, SumoSun. He is in a very creative 
  period at the moment and is very inspired. This is great.. Anyway, We arrive 
  at Studenterhuset and about 17:55 and Siena Root are setting their gear up for 
  soundcheck and Ralph is here to do the sound. I thought he was still in California. 
  Great that he is here. The Swedes and Magnus are suppose to arrive at 18 but 
  are running late and do not get here until nearly 19. Not a big deal as the 
  Siena Root Soundcheck is going super slow. Nice to see these guys again. Really 
  amazing people. I like them very much. </p>
<p>Quite a few other shows happening tonight. I hope some people show up..Mogens, 
  Stefan, Thomas and Magnus are talking about how to play tonight. What kind of 
  tuning. Stefan is tuned down to D and so will Thomas. Magnus will play in A 
  as he usually does. We talk about how to create dynamics. This is a good talk 
  to have. We rarely do this. </p>
<p>20:00 Things are running really late.We have not even started our soundcheck. 
  People are hungry and thirsty. Mogens has disappeared to look for a USB cable 
  for his X-station. Ralph tells us we can only play 45 minutes. We had hoped 
  to play for 75 minutes. We will see.. Too early to tell.. I had hoped we would 
  be able to start at 21 but there is no way now. </p>
<p>21:30. We finished the soundcheck at 21:15 and ran off to eat and I am getting 
  my costume on and will start with some synth improv on the Octave Cat while 
  the others get high....</p>
<p>23:15 Wow.. after a nightmare soundcheck with bad cables and massive delays 
  we did get to play with a full belly of food. Slows you down a bit. Mogens is 
  feeling ill..This was a far out show. We play extremely melodic like I have 
  not heard us play. Stefan really took the lead in the sound tonight and played 
  some really cool stuff and this put pressure on Magnus and he was killer as 
  well. I think we all played pretty nicely. I had some trouble controlling the 
  CAT at times but managed. I could not hear Mogens synths at all in the mointors. 
</p>
<p>Sold 4 copies of It's all about Delay...</p>

  from Gas Giant, Nils, Anders,Kai, Susan, Dorte, Jesper, Jens (very drunk), Foxy, 
  Tom.. </p>
