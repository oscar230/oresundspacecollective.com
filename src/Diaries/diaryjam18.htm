    <font size="4" color="#FFFF00">This was our CD release party and we had just
      got our CD and the t-shirts and it was going to be a great night despite the
      fact that it was like -5C outside. Damn cold. We were the only band and I was
      really hoping that people would show up and they did! We started about 10 minutes
      after 22 as I had planned and played for about an hour. We had a great energy.
      The place was filling up slowly. I was selling a few CDs and t-shirts but it
      was a great vibe. We started the 2nd set about 23:30 and wow, there were a lot
      of people, I guess about 65 or when I looked around. We were really flying and
      played the best stuff of the set this time around. Most of our Swedish friends,
      Tobias and Dorte, Kaufmann, Inzect and some of his friends, Erik and Petter
      as well as my friends in Gas Giant (Tommy, thomas and Jesper) and many other
      people I knew. Johnny brought Suzzane and Göran from Drahk von Trip. IT
      was just a great night. Jocke, played bass on the 3rd set and it was great to
      have him back playing with us. We had spent a lot of time getting the PA set
      up right and we had an amazing sound this night as you can also hear on the
      recording. The whole band was flying… IT was late when we finished but
      not as late as usual. I was exhausted but had an amazing time. </font>
