<p><strong><font size="4">Session 31- Semifinal, Helsinki, Finland 08/4/07</font></strong></p>
<p>9:30 People were up pretty late. The Ferry arrives in one hour. Magnus and 
  Sebastian, who I shared a cabin with (because none of us snore. We put the 4 
  snoring people all together.. ), they did not come into the cabin until 3.4 
  in the morning. Seb was ok but Magnus pretty wasted... He is sleeping now... 
  I did not sleep that well last night although I crashed around 12 or so after 
  going up and hanging out with the guys near the bar. Very bad entertainment 
  everywhere... Lots of Finnish people, mainly. People are drinking a lot everywhere... 
  very unhealthy. anyway,. just had some juice, a tiger's milk bar and a shower. 
  I feel pretty fresh now. </p>
<p>The wake up bell telling us we have to be downstairs at the van just rang. 
  Magnus is crashed hard still. Seb and the others are up now. Mogens and S&oslash;ren 
  also look tired. Michael, Luz and I don't drink much so we are for sure the 
  freshest..It was a really nice time just hanging out together and talking about 
  all sorts of things last night. We are really a like kind of bunch of people 
  who really get along on a real basic level... This is what makes for long lasting 
  musical frienships.... I hope some years down the line we will be able to celebrate 
  coming together and playing in Finland for the 10th time or something...</p>
<p>12:00 We came off the ferry with no hassles but Seb and Magnus were running 
  up to the van as we were holding up the cue (only for 30 seconds) for letting 
  other cars out behind us. We cruised into town and everything is pretty much 
  closed on this easter sunday. We go to the local Subway sandwich place and hang 
  out until Santtu comes to meet us. We will go to his rehearsal place and just 
  hang out until we can get into the venue at 16 or so. Hidria will come at 17 
  to soundcheck first since they will play last. We are just chilling out and 
  listening to the Soundtrack to the movie More by Pink Floyd. Great album... 
  The joints and the beers are starting now... </p>
<p>13:30 Juha, Santtu's DJ partner for the night and a total vinyl collector has 
  arrived. He is a really cool guy and we have a lot of laughs with him. Jarrie 
  from Octopus Syng is here as well. He has some really cool records to play tonight 
  like Circulus (A UK band he highly recommends), GONG, Sundial, etc..</p>
<p>14:06 s&oslash;ren is playing drums in the rehearsal room. He is joined by 
  Michael on bass, Jarrie on sitar and Santtu on djembe. They play some pretty 
  strange music. Santtu has recorded some of it...</p>
<p>Listen to a few of the jams here... <a href="../New%20MP3/rehearsal%20drums%20and%20bass%20jam.mp3">Drum 
  and Bass 1</a>, <a href="../New%20MP3/rehearsal%20drum-bass%20jam1.mp3">Drum 
  and Bass 2</a>, <a href="../New%20MP3/rehearsal%20sitar%20jam.mp3">Sitar Jam</a> 
</p>
<p>14:26 People are getting really high now with everyone taking turns making 
  joints.... Pretty much only the Finnish guys are drinking beers. I am pretty 
  quiet just checking everyone out. Luz and Juha are talking, The others are jamming, 
  mogens and I are just chilling. </p>
<p>15:25 Kalle, the guy who will do the projections and Samuel from Wasami and 
  Inner Light Orchestra are here now. We have been playing around with these cool 
  Owl masks that we will bring to the gig and people are in a really good mood. 
  Juha is looking quite wasted and has opened a bottle of red wine. He and Jarrie 
  drink most of it... Seb, S&oslash;ren and Michael have returned from getting 
  some more food. It is very smoky in here as these people smoke almost all the 
  time. Luz and I are the only ones who don't smoke cigarettes.. awful.. </p>
<p>17:15 All the Hidria guys are here and it is so great to see them all again. 
  We help them to load their gear in. We came 30 minutes earlier and have all 
  our stuff in the club. It is a small club but it has a high ceiling and a big 
  stage. Kalle is setting up his projector and stuff.. Rob Dreamworker, who flew 
  over with his family from England has come to take some pics at the soundcheck 
  and stuff. Really super cool person. I wish I had more time to talk with him. 
  There are just so many things to make sure they go right and check and people 
  to talk to. Hemppa (old Dark SUn drummer) is here. He will do the Hidria Sound. 
</p>
<p>20:00 We just had a cool soundcheck and some food. Garlic potatoes, lamb stew 
  and salad with juice. We only get one free beer each. Luckily we have a lot 
  in the van. Some people are starting to show up. Lots of girls.. The visuals 
  are going to look great. THe new Spacious Mind CD is playing now. Sounds cool... 
  I am just chilling out getting relaxed before we will start. </p>
<p>20:45 Seems a lot of people are nervous. The club is pretty packed already. 
  Everyone is getting really stoned.. Sebastian is not feeling all that well.. 
  Nerves??</p>
<p>02:30 Wow.... what a fucking night. We played a very very stoned concert for 
  about 100 minutes. Where was the energy? I felt like I played really well and 
  Michael, S&oslash;ren and Luz were way better today than in Stockholm... Our 
  guitarist... could never let loose.. just let it go.. Very hesitant. Set yourself 
  free and just play.... both guys are brilliant guitar players... We are very 
  lucky to play with such talented people... They could not fly tonight... stoned 
  in our zone.... People loved our set of laid back space groove music. Mogens 
  and I played some cool stuff. Everyone did.. </p>
<p>Hidria, fucking hell... they just blasted the place to pieces with a really 
  heavy and jamming gig. I think they only play 6 songs in like 75 minutes. They 
  played 4 songs from the new CD and a couple of old ones. I was totally blown 
  away. What a band.. Teemu said they had not played such a heavy gig in 2-3 years. 
</p>
<p>The gig was totally sold out and they had to turn people away at the door. 
  Amazing crowd. Sold like 5 or 6 cds.. Place to sell stuff was in a bad place 
  and it was impossible for people to come over there. Mikko from Dark Sun video 
  taped our set. Should look cool as I was told the visuals were really great 
  that Kalle did. I can't wait to see the video. </p>
<p>Oh yeah.. there was a sort of strange jam session for like 30 minutes. I had 
  asked the Hidria guys if they wanted to jam and it seemed like some of them 
  did but then 5 minutes later none of them did. I set up my gear again and so 
  did Magnus. Mogens came out to play Lokku's keys, s&oslash;ren on drums, Samuel 
  on bass and Jarrie on guitar. Jarrie was playing all this blues stuff with no 
  effects and not spacey at all. I could not figure out anything to play with 
  him. The last 10 minutes he was playing just riffs and there was a very CAN 
  like groove going. That wascool but I was not playing. I think it was pretty 
  much crap, unfortunately... It turns out it was a bad idea... Sorry people...</p>
<p>Here are a couple of the pieces from this not so great jam.. Jam 1 <a href="../New%20MP3/post%20Concert%20Jam.mp3">Jam 
  2</a></p>
<p>3:30 We are back at the Dark Sun rehearsal space and some people are pretty 
  fucked up and very stoned. Santtu is quite drunk, as is Jarrie. We will hang 
  out here until like 5 and then we have to drive 2 hrs to the ferry in Turku. 
</p>
<p>It was a great two concerts... </p>
