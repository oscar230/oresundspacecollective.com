<p>The Black Tomato digipack CD arrived yesterday and it looks amazing. We are 
  so happy... Toady started off difficult as Inzect, who had promised to provide 
  the projector and come to the show tonight had decided to just blow us off and 
  I did not find this out until 3:30 in the afternoon when I tracked him down 
  at work (no answer to SMS or calls on his mobiel the whole week after saying 
  last week he was coming..gave me a warning..). Anyway.. then he says he will 
  get it and give it to the others who are coming over from Sweden and he blows 
  us off again. Fuck off Inzect, we don't need people like you...... Anyway, Thomas 
  saved the day and we borrowed one he had access to... phew...</p>
<p>17:15 I arrive at the Dragens Hule with all the merchandise (should not both 
  as we never sell anything at these shows). We sold 6 cds last night.. nothing 
  else. Also all the food I had made (Posole and salad and bread). Mogens was 
  there and almost up with his gear and he helped me bring in all the stuff. Thomas 
  and Stefan showed up soon after and were in a great mood. Stefan set up his 
  stuff and Thomas and I went to get the projector. PIB was there when we got 
  back and we all ate someof the food and this chile sausage that I brought that 
  was killer hot.. They really liked the food a lot and we had some beers and 
  then a soundcheck. Sound was really good. </p>
<p>18:45 Tobias calls and says Jocke can't get off work until 19. Cool..</p>
<p>19:15 Tobias calls and say they forgot the t-shirts and have to go back and 
  get them. They were almost at the bridge. Glad he remembered.</p>
<p>20:15 Tobias arrives and sets up. We had already had a nice little soundcheck 
  and Stefan gave me a gift CD, a song he made just for me. Fucking cool... Mogens 
  and Kasper gave me a Leaf vapourizer.. wow.... GUf from Baby Woodrose was down 
  as well and gave me the promo of the new Baby Woodrose and said I was the first 
  one to get one as had just got them today. Thanks GUF:... Steen has also arrived 
  now and set up the video camera. </p>
<p>22:00 Still very few people but we will start soon anyway.. NIce to see Tom, 
  Jens, Anders, Nils, Martin, Lene, Morgan, Stojs, Palle, Guf, and Michael and 
  Magnus from the OSC. </p>
<p>23:45 The first set was about 80 minutes and pretty amazing stuff was played. 
  I felt really good about it. Both guitar players were flying and so were Mogens 
  and I. PIB and Thomas played cool as well. The 30 people seem to really dig 
  it as well and the visuals were awesome..</p>
<p>24:15 We start the 2nd set and I put on the horned mask with the alien mask 
  (no pics from my camera).....This set was also about 80 minutes and really heavy 
  and spaced at times. Lene from Cherry Overdrive/Fuzz Manta did some imp&aring;rov 
  vocals at the very end of the last jam. Wow.. Some more different quite drunk 
  people have showed up (Ralph, Anders H,....). I was quite tired after this and 
  was not sure we would play more but people really wanted to. The band was really 
  high by this time as a lot of joints were smoked in this place. </p>
<p>2:15 The 3rd set began and Magnus was playing synths on Mogens set up and Thomas 
  (passed out during the 2nd set) was back playing again. I only played a little 
  bit and then Henrik from Suck a Bug played on my synth for a bit at the end 
  (20 minutes). Pib stopped on drums and Tobias switched from guitar to drums 
  for like 5 minutes and then some other guy came and played PIBs drums as well 
  (Jason Beck?). A few parts were ok but a lot of it was a mess.... Magnus played 
  some amazing stuff though.. He should join us only on synths sometime for sure.. 
  Great musician... </p>

  hanging about.. </p>
