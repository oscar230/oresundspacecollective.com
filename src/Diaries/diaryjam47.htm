      <font size="4">Session 47 Diary</font>
    </strong></p>
  <p>This was the CD release party for our 5th CD, Good Planets are hard to Find
    on the Transubstans Label. I was not sure about playing but damn I had an amazing
    time playing with these guys. Anyway, we switched the bass players and guitarists
    a bit on this night and played for 3hrs. </p>
  <p>The Carpet Knights were suppose to open the show (3 of their members often
    play with us) but sadly the singer and drummer were ill. </p>
  <p>20:29 The Swedes from Carpet Knights arrived with the new CD and it looks great.
    We have most all the gear but not the projector up and running. Thanks to Magnus
    for helping us out to get this up and running. It is going to be a cool night,
    I just hope some people show up. The Sumo Sun guys stop in after a full day
    of mixing in the studio. They leave before we start to play. </p>
  <p>00:15 We just finished the first set of about 70 minutes long and had some
    really cool grooves and some really spacey stuff as well. It had a good feeling.
    This was the first time ever to have Nick from the Univerzals playing with us
    and he totally fits in well with us for sure. Cool guitar player.. Thomas played
    the bass on this set and laid down the killer groove. Phew... Only about 25-30
    people, so quite a poor turn out. We are taking quite a long break and Pär
    will play bass in the next set.</p>
  <p>1:30 That was a strange 2nd set. Thomas played guitar on Tobias's set up and
    he was just too stoned to play. Took 5 mins for him to figure out his tuning
    and he just never got into it until the very end. Gave the set a very strange
    vibe as Pär was kicking ass on the bass and being the lead instrument.
    Far out set and less than 50 mins since Thomas was out of it, sadly. He is a
    great bass player but not good enough on the guitar to play in OSC. Not at this
    time anyway.. </p>
  <p>03:15 Wow.. now that was a killer 3rd set. Jocke played the bass and Nick and
    Tobias were back on the guitars. Søren played some percussion and Magnus
    took over Mogens synths. Very trance groove material. Smoking guitars as well
    but a bit lost in the mix, which was not as good as the first set. Fun fun night...</p>
  <p>We sold 8 cds (I think) and had a good time. Only 20 paid people so we only
    got 800kr. 500 goes to the Swedes to pay for the bridge and gas. I did not get
    home until 4:15.. totally exhausted....</p>
  <p>Next stop Finland...</p>
  <p>Set I 71:23</p>
  <p>In Search of a new World 18:57, Interstellar Collision 13:53, I need to Go
    21:56, Whipping Stick 15:30, Band introductions 1:04</p>
  <p>Set II</p>
  <p>Stoooned 29:22, Crush it Down 17:23</p>
  <p>Set III</p>
  <p>Hiding in your Pocket 29:01, Get it on Up 12:44, Black Trance Pants 23:29</p>
