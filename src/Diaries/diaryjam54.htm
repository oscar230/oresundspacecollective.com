  </p>
  <p>10:00 I never felt like I lost complete consciousness last night so I am in
    a bit of a daze. Luck for me there wasnot a lot of snoring last night as we
    were all more or less sleeping in this big laft. We had matresses, so that was
    nice. I went upstairs to sleep soon after we got back so I have no idea when
    they all went to sleep but I guess they were up having more beers and joints
    for some hours. We need to try to be on the road around 12 to make it to Sojo
    for the soundcheck at 15. It is a beautiful day outside and check out the view
    from where we stayed:</p>

  <p>I need to go out and find a cord at a music shop so I can use my Kaossosolator
    tonight....</p>
  <p>12:15 We are leaving Leiden and I was able to find a music store and get the
    cord I needed. Phew.. Amazing day outside and everyone is in a great mood. </p>
  <p>13:45 We are about 60-75km from Antwerp now. We missed the last exits in Holland
    so no coffee shop stops for us. Pity. We have listened to the new Bakerton Group-El
    Rojo CD, Five Fiftennn- Psychedelic singalongs for stadiums, and this instrumental
    CD called Arctica II. Some really cool stuff. </p>
  <p>15:15 We have arrived and people are chilling out and smoking. </p>

    and mogens relax</p>
  <p>15:53 Nick, Pär and I were talking about the parallels between sports
    and an OSC concert. The fans can get equally worked up up depending on which
    side of the stage is dominating and the direction ofthe jam. Some are cheering
    for one guy over the other.. Strange but funny. YOu had to be there...</p>
  <p>16:04 We are almost all set up for soundcheck. Hypnos 69 will not do a soundcheck
    as this is where they rehearse and all their gear is already to go, etc.. This
    is nice for us. I have set up all the merch and microphones for recording so
    all is set. </p>
  <p>17:26 We had an OK soundcheck and they were working on some possible jam modulations
    for later. I recorded about 20 mins of the soundcheck. Maybe it will appearr
    somewhere someday. Food is at 18 and we will play at 19:30 on time. I hope there
    are a lot of people. </p>
  <p>18:00 I have been finding some new sounds on the Kaossolator in the backstage.
    Nick is playing the guitar and said it was nice to be on tour with Fidel Castro
    and Gandalf! (referring to Pär and me). Magnus is putting new strings on
    this guitar and nick is practicing. </p>
  <p>18:50 We had a nice dinner- big salad and veggie lasagna. Nick is trying to
    sleep but everyone else is enjoying a beer and preparing for space rocking.
    We will play for about 90 mins. Met a guy who is a friend of Sara and Benni's
    and he said that he was a big fan after hearing all of It's all about Delay
    at their house on evening and they played it over and over.. Cool. </p>
  <p>21:30 The fans loved the show and it was packed with people. I think we played
    a bit of a sleepy set compared to the night before but still some great stuff.
    The 2nd jam was really cool, we all felt. Pär was amazing on the bass this
    night. I could hardly hear Magnus but he seemed to be ripping it up. Nick was
    much better the night before.PIB, well, he is amazing as well. Mogens and I
    did our jobs well also and played lots of cool solos and space sounds. I am
    having some nice chats with the fans who have bought a lot of merch from us.
    People came from HOlland, belgium and even France to see us. That is cool. </p>
  <p>22:15 Hypnos69 are really amazing. Wow. What a band. I had never seen them.
    The crowd was really into it as well. Some very King Crimson inspired material.
    We have been chatting with Steve D, a huge Ozrics and space rock fan outside.
    Cool guy. He was in thefront row for the show and totally into it. </p>
  <p>02:30 We finally getto crash out. A great and fun night.</p>
