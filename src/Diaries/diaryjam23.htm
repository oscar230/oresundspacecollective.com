<p><strong><font size="4">&Oslash;resund Space Collective Session 23- Malm&ouml;festivalen, 
  Malmo, Sweden 8/21/06</font></strong></p>
<p> This was our first gig ever in Sweden and at the most important summer festival 
  in the south of Sweden. We were very honored and happy to get the chance to 
  play. I met up with Magnus, Sonja, and Michael at about 16:30. We packed the 
  car and Sonja and I drove over and Michael and Magnus took the bus and train 
  to Sweden. We are not getting paid enough money to afford to rent a van so everyone 
  has to take the train over (150DKK per person= $25) and Sonja and I drive my 
  car (costs 470DKK= $80) to drive over the bridge, which is also not cheap! Anyway, 
  we have no problems finding the place and Ola and Sebastian are already there 
  waiting for us having a beer. </p>
<p>We check out the stage, the sound and light system, eat some food and go check 
  out the band Dungen. We meet up with all our friends including the other members 
  of the OSC (Tobias, Kaufmann, Jocke) who unfortuantely will not get to play 
  with us as we have such a short set. Dungen are quite good as usual. THis was 
  my 4th time to see them. Great and original guitar player. After Dungen, the 
  rest are now showing up and everyone is in a great mood. We just hanging out 
  and talk with our friends while we wait and listen to Reverend Vince Anderson 
  from Brooklyn, NY. He plays pretty cool gospel blues and tells stories. He was 
  very entertaining. </p>
<p>Anyway, 21:20, we hit the stage and were setting up the gear. It all went pretty 
  smooth and we were sitting around talking. We only had a monitor and line check 
  with Beatte, no real sound check. Anyway, I went and changed into my alien mask 
  and orange jumpsuit and we hit the stage at 22 sharp, with some space sounds 
  and then straight into a sort of folky riff in G by Sebastian. The first jam 
  we were sort of finding our feet so to speak and trying to get the monitor sound 
  right. I could hear everything except Magnus. It was not loud on the stage at 
  all, which was really nice. I dedicated the first one to some young kid who 
  was hanging out at the front when we soundchecked and wanted it a song dedicated 
  to him, and then he was not even there. Ha... out sniffing glue... Anyway, the 
  60 mins went by really fast but it was a cool laid back set. I never felt like 
  we reached any peak intensity but just played well. Very spacey synths.. Ola 
  had a new Kaospad2 and played the Fender Rhodes a little bit,. This was the 
  first time he had had that at a jam session in a long time, He could not hear 
  it in the monitor though and never got it high enough that he played it quite 
  little. The last jam was the best and we really had a cool groove going that 
  we had to cut short.. damn.. Anyway, a great 60min set. Everyone we talked to 
  really liked it as well. Sold a few CDs, one shirt and passed out a lot of flyers. 
</p>
<p>We hung out for an hour and then Sonja and I drove back while everyone else 
  hung out to party in Malm&ouml;!</p>
