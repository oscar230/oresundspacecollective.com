      <font size="5">OSC goes to Finland March 20-23rd, 2009</font>
    </strong></p>
  <p>8:37 I am getting on the train to go to Malmö to pick up the 9 person
    Ford Transit van and drive it back to Denmark to pick up PIB; NIck and Mogens
    and all our gear. We need to be on the road by 12 or so to make the ferry at
    20:10 in Stockholm and to pick up Sebastian in Mjölby. The weather is beautiful
    and sunny but with a cold wind. IT is suppose to be down to -10C in Finland.
    We will see. We are excited as the Finnish crowds are great. </p>
  <p>9:05 I arrive at Hertz but the van is not yet ready. They have to clean it
    and get the odometer reading. We will pick up Mattias, a friend of Sebastians
    on the ferry and he will join us on the trip to help out (and later play bass
    in Helsinki). He used to play guitar in Gostas Berlings Saga, a Stockholm band.
    . Amazing weather today.. I got an SMS from PIB and his bike is dead and he
    wants me to pick him up. </p>
  <p>11:20 Just picked up PIB outside christiania and we are waiting for mogens.
    Nick is here and getting his gear ready. </p>

  <p>12:05 We are just leaving now. It was a hard ride for mogens with all his stuff
    on one of these longjohn bikes all the way from Vesterbro. He is sweaty! </p>
  <p>16:35 We are in Mjölby resting a bit. The drive has been no problem and
    we have been listing to a lot of cool music including ZZTOP (Mescalaro), Seid-
    Amongst the Flowers, Stone Oak Cosmonaut, Pothead, Taipuva Lutisuora, etc..
    Everyone is a in a great mood. We have plenty of time to make it to Stockholm.
  </p>
  <p>17:35 We are at a gas station filling up before heading to Finland (turns out
    gas is about the same price). We just heard the whole Antibalas CD- WHo is this
    America?. Great amazing CD. We have about 1½ hrs to the ferry or less.
    Seems it is around 100km or so.</p>
  <p>22:30 We had a really meal (Tapas) with Mattias and Sebastian and some beers.
    Mattias does not drink or smoke or drive... damn on the later.. Anyway, very
    cool guy. I am very tired, some were already asleep now. I am in my own cabin
    with some Finnish guy. Nice. I have to avoid any snoring people or I get no
    sleep at all. I thought about the Sauna but in the end did not go.</p>
  <p><strong>March 20th</strong></p>
  <p>6:25 Don't think I slept at all this night. Just laid there and seem to have
    thoughts in my head the whole night. Ulf was very quiet. It was very quiet on
    the ship. I was comfortable, not sure why I feel like I did not get any sleep.
    IT is going to be a hard day. They are starting to clean the cabins now and
    have opened up the breakfast. I have a juice box and a granola bar. <img src="../Jam%20Pics/Session%2048-49/house-in-the-ice.jpg" width="307" height="230">Small

  <p>9:30 We are hanging out at a market/cofffee bar a few km from Turku. Cold and
    a bit windy but nice to be in Finland. We are listning to the 2nd Taipuva CD.
    Cool stuff and quite different from the 1st one. We will now hear the Stone
    the Crows BBC 1970 disc, which is amazing...</p>

    and I outside the Market.</p>
  <p>11:49.. We are sitting at the address that Juha gave us and have been in contact
    with Jairre, who has the key and is to let us in. JUha will get off work at
    15-16 and then we will head to Hyvinkää. Anyway, It takes us an hour
    or something to figure out where he is and where we are and why he is not here
    and in the end, the address was not correct and he was at theother end of this
    street, which was blocked off from the end we were on..... We are tired and
    hungry. I need to sleep..</p>
  <p>14:00 We have just been hanging out at Juha's. Very nice apartment and amazing
    record collection. I got a little rest, hope it will be enough for me. People
    are enjoying themselves having some joints, beers, cigs... we need some food.
    Heard a new Finnish band called the Cosmic Wizards Music Club. Interesting stuff.
  </p>
  <p>17:45 We arrive at the Zoom Bar in Hyvinkää! Only two of the guys
    from Taipuva are there yet. Stage is quite small and we will be packed in on
    this stage for sure. We are moving the stuff around to try to best make us all
    fit on there. Both bands have 6 members. This place is super smoky.. I will
    have to go outside all the time and it is damn cold out, like -5C. The sound
    guy is super cool and named Johnny. THe booker is also a great guy nammed Jukka.
    This is a total rocker bar for sure..</p>
  <p>18:00 Had a nice chat with the Taipuva guys (Ville, esko, etc..) and have set
    up the mics for recording. </p>

  <p>18:30. Only need PIB and we will be finished with the soundcheck. I am hungry
    and hope we can finish in 45 min or less. We will then have to take all of my
    geat and mogens off the stage again and PIB will have to put his drums in the
    corner and reset thenm all up again as they have an electronic kit. </p>
  <p>21:30 Taipuva just finished their soundcheck and will go get some food. They
    will try to start at 22:30 but it seems unlikely. It will be a very late night
    for sure. Everyone is in a great mood and the people are very nice. I think
    it will be amazing. Music has to stop at 2:30 in the morning. Bar closes at
    3. </p>
  <p>00:20 We are almost set up and Taipuva was really amazing, despite all the
    sound problems that they encournter, including the drums disappearing from the
    monitors, which with electric drums means now one can hear the drums. That must
    be strange... I am really feeling like a zombie and don't expect I will play
    that well, but you never know.. Mogens is having some problems. </p>
  <p>1:40. We are taking a break now. That was the first set, about 55 minutes.
    Band needs to go smoke and have a beer. The music has given me a bit of boost
    and I am feeling much better now. I think we had some really cool jams in this
    set. </p>
  <p>3:00 I am totally wrecked...gave it my all. The crowd was really into it here
    during this 2nd set and we would have played more but they needed us to stop
    so they could get the people out and clean up the place. Guys are loading the
    gear. I am just resting since I have to drive the 60km back to helsinki. Jaire
    and Juha are quite drunk... THey both enjoyed the show a lot. Especially Juha.
    Jaire seem to be talking to people most of thetime. Several members of the audience
    said this was the coolest concert and only band to have ever played this music
    in this toun. The promoter Jukka was quite blown away. We will be invited back
    for sure. We got 335€ from the door, which is quite good. The drive will
    be tough.</p>
  <p>4:45 Finally get to sleep.... </p>
