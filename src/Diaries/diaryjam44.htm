    <font size="3">8:50 I have loaded up the car to go over to Malmo
      and am just waiting for Mogens to arrive. I picked up all his gear last night
      and we should have plenty of space for PIBs stuff since I am not bringing the
      Octave Cat. Then we are off to Hertz in Malmo to meet Par. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">10:15 We have just picked up the van and Par was waiting. All
    is smooth so far now off to Tobias's house to park my car and move the stuff
    into the van and then hit the road!</p>
  <p align="left">11:00 All is moved over and Par will do the first driving. We
    are on the road. IT is a beautiful sunny day and quite warm but windy. We are
    listening to Sonar from Hungary.</p>

  <p align="left"><img src="../Jam%20Pics/Session%2044/awesome-mushroom.jpg" width="204" height="307">Cool
    mushrooms where we made a pit stop!</p>
  <p align="left">16:15 We are doing really fine time wise. Mogens and PIB slept
    for a while. We heard the OSC 37 mixes, Pothead, Frank Zappa. We are only about
    15 mins from Stockholm. Par is driving. Nice that I don't have to do all the
    driving. </p>
  <p align="left">17:15 We are in Stockholm now. Traffic was a nightmare. We are
    dropping Par off to visit some friends in Stockholm and he will come up to Uppsala
    tomorrow. He says he is going to get drunk tonight as he plays better with a
    hangover! We have come up with some potential song titles: Alien Hand Syndrome,
    Dick Hertz, No smoking yur pets</p>
  <p align="left">20:00 Unreal traffic between Stockholm andUppsala. I had to pee
    so bad that I almost was going to pee out the door of the van while driving
    but luckily the traffic broke and we could get to a rest stop. Took 2 hrs from
    Stockholm toUppsala and it is only like 75 km. Fuck... Anyway, we have arrived
    at Christians in a little town like 30 km from Uppsala. A beautiful place right
    on the lake! </p>
  <p align="left"><img src="../Jam%20Pics/Session%2044/beautiful-sweden.jpg" width="600" height="400"></p>
  <p align="left">The place we are staying has a lot of cool instruments. Guitars,
    lap steel, synths, Korg Kaossilator (I play around with this and I need one
    of these. very cool). I am pretty sure that I will sleep outside in the forest
    next to this lake as if we sleep in this little house the band, Mass of the
    Sun are going to arrive at 5:30 in the morning to rehearse! </p>
  <p align="left">23:00 A nice jam session with PIB and MOgens playing guitar and
    keyboard. SOme of the band are here and Christian from Mass of the Sun's sister
    as well. They all leave soon.<img src="../Jam%20Pics/Session%2044/pib-lap-steel.jpg" width="204" height="307"><img src="../Jam%20Pics/Session%2044/mogen-keys.jpg" width="307" height="204"></p>
  <p align="left">24:00 I crash outin the forest. </p>
  <p align="left">August 30th</p>
  <p align="left">9:15 I am up but Christian got me up at 6:40 to move the van.
    I had ear plugs but I could still hear the band play this morning. Seems they
    did not play long. I did not sleep all the well but some was very deep. Fresh
    air out here. It is a beautiful day outside. Wow...</p>
  <p align="left">9:54 We are just hanging out. Guys from Mass of the SUn had to
    come back and get some extension cords and mattresses for later. </p>
  <p align="left">12:45 We arrived at the venue and dropped off thegear and are
    sitting outside at a nice cafe and having some food. They are running behind
    and the concert will not start on time, this is for sure! </p>
  <p align="left">13:30 The first band, Porcelain are still soundchecking. and not
    very many people have arrived considering it was suppose to start at 13:00.
    Maybe 10 people? I just hope it does not get delayed like KIldemose Festival.
  </p>
  <p align="left">14:05 Porcelain from FInland starts the show. They start off with
    what is like a jam and then it gest quite heavy. Great band. Do a cover of the
    Swedish band, 30 Years War. </p>
  <p align="left">20:00 I jammed with First Band from Outer Space for a really intense
    concert with only 3 songs-jams in an hour. The crowd was totally into it. It
    was great fun as well even though I did not know the first two new songs at
    all. </p>
  <p align="left">23:00 We went down really well with the crowd and many said we
    were the best band. I hope so. I had a lot of technical problems with distortion
    on my channels which I did not have when I played with FBFOS and we just moved
    my position from where I was playing and not the gear at all. The line boxes
    were changed. Pity.... Crowd said the distortion on my stuff sounded cool and
    it sounds okk on the audience but not on the multitrack recording.</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway,... that is all I can say now. We had an amazing time at
    this great festival. A real pity more people did not turn out. Maybe 250?</p>
