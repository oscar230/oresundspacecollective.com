    <font color="#FFFF00">Wow! Jam 19...and the first time we have jammed in Malm&ouml;
      since last May. Great to have Kaufmann back drumming and nice to play with Tobias,
      Jonas (Kaabel) and G&ouml;ran (Drahk van Trip). This was an experimental night
      in some way as we recorded the whole session onto 8 track using a Fostex hard
      disc recorder. Anyway, I arrived at 17:15 at the Mantric Muse rehearsal room
      and without too much fucking around we were off to Netto to get beer and then
      to Sweden. The car was a little crowded and Michael had to have his bass head
      on his lap in the front seat but it is a short trip and we cruised through the
      customs without being stopped and drove straight to the Folket's Hus without
      getting lost! They were just setting up when we got there and this continued
      for many hours. We did not play any music before 21 as there were a lot of cables,
      microphones and 3 different mixers to get all set up. Kaufmann had like 11 microphones
      on his drum kit going into one mixer, that was then mixed down to 2 channels.
      The guitarist all went into another mixer and sadly were mixed together. I will
      explain later. JOnas (NOvation NOvaII), Ola (Nord MOdular and Laptop computer
      running lots of different soft synths), and myself with the NOrd Lead 2 all
      went into one mixer and then into 2 channels. The bass had its own channel as
      did Kasper's conga and djembe set up. THe sound on the multitrack is really
      great and you will get to hear it as well. </font>

    <font color="#FFFF00"> Anyway, as almost always happens, it was very difficult
      to find the right balance of guitar levels, which you will hear on the MD and
      multitrack recordings. During the first jam, Magnus was far too low and Tobias
      just right. After that Tobias turned down and Magnus turned up and it was the
      opposite now. IT was very loud as usual but we all had a great time. I had some
      problems with the mini-disc and missed a few pieces of music, when we were soundchecking,
      one 12 min jam with G&ouml;ran from Drahk van Trip that dropped in and the very
      end of the session. We will see what the multitrack sounds like. It was great
      fun as always and everyone played pretty well. Michael played very cool bass
      lines and magnus really experimented with some tripped out sound as well as
      Ola, playing some synth that sounded like Magnus's glissando guitar! Check out
      Kaufmann's amazing drumming on Kaufmann's Space. Great night.....</font>
