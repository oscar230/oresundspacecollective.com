        Tornado Studios, Copenhagen 10-11/3/06 </b></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">This is our 2nd studio session and people are very excited
      about it. As always we will experiment with a different set up. I arrived over
      to the MM rehearsal space place at about 16 and only Michael and Magnus were
      there (listening to our last session in Malmö). Magnus was packing up his
      gear and Michael, he already had so he was just smoking... At 16:30, we started
      to kick into high gear and to move the stuff out of the room and up to the Black
      Tornado Studio (which is just upstairs). Around this time, the Swedes sent an
      SMS and were leaving Malmo. We were pretty ready. I had bought 2 cases of beer,
      søren, 6 1.5 liter bottles of coke, mogens and kasper a lot of bread
      and Michael and magnus bought like 600kr worth of food for the night and tomorrow,
      so we would not have to waste anytime going out for pizza or something. Lars
      arrived a bit before 5 and we had just started to move stuff into the studio
      recording room. We have a lot of gear, even more than last time. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">18:00- Lars is setting up the mics on the drums and decides
      only to use 4, which is 3 less than last time. (Kick drum, two snare mics, overhead
      and one more). </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">It is starting look like at a concert in a way with the
      drums in the middle and Michael and magnus on the left, Sebastian on the right
      and all of us synth players at the back. We set up the Mantric Muse PA in the
      studio so it would be much more like playing at a live gig and people would
      not have to wear headphones. Only, ola, kasper and myself got sound via headphones
      (and also the PA). Only the synths were coming out of the PA and it appeared
      only to be a problem with Kasper's mics on the congas (so they were moved closer)
      and maybe a bit in the drum overhead mic but the sound was fantastic in the
      listening room. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">20:07</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Soundcheck for most of the instruments is finished now
      and we are working on the synths and getting this into the PA at the right levels,
      etc... We manage with 24 tracks but we really need a few more as it would be
      nice to have more on the drums and also to be able to play the OCtave Cat but
      there are no more channels unless Lars does some reconfiguring of his system.
      He said we were the first band ever to need more than 24 tracks! I am sensing
      that people are getting hungry and now high, after a lot of joints have been
      smoked but only a few beers drunk. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">21:00 </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">We finally get to give it a try, after a cool Iron Man
      jam. Sebastian spent an hour playing guitar or more to break in the new strings
      and warm up, playing some great stevie ray vaughn like blues with mogens on
      the grand piano and jocke on the bass... quite cool. IT was not recorded. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Kasper is having a lot of problems and magnus is too
      high and then too low and it is damn loud in the recording room but overall
      it is going well. We hafvlike a 13 min jam and then come and see how it sounds
      and if Lars is having any technical problems. Jocke is just hanging out now
      and will play on the next jam. He and Michael will switch back and forth.</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Now, we go for it and record for about 37 mins more and
      play a jam with some really heavy riffing and ripping solos and totally far
      out synths. I think the synth players need to smoke more to get into the groove.
      51 minutes recorded so far.</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">23:00 It is now 11 and I am starving to death. We all
      eat some food and then we really want to play some more. Lots of beers, more
      joints (skunk and hash), the peace pipe, and some coca cola and we are ready
      to fly again. The stuff we have recorded so far is sounding really excellent.
      Lars is an amazing studio tech.. Wow...</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">23:45</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Now, we go into the room and people are feeling really
      high from the music and other things and we play for over 2 hrs more with some
      people coming and going and the music is really Krautrock like with stoned and
      hypnotic grooves and amazing synths... I think Ola really has his system going
      and Mogens is playing cool stuff and I really am happy with the sounds I have
      found and am modulating on. Very intense stuff and about 2 hrs recorded at this
      time point. I have trouble hearing the guitars when I wear the headphones but
      the synth sounds are so good in the headphones. I switch on and off. Both Sebastian
      and Magnus are playing some killer intense guitar. Jocke plays very smooth bass
      lines. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">00:30</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">This next jam is very long, like 41 minutes straight.
      We have another jam without the drums that is very hypnotic with great dynamics
      between Michael, magnus and myself. Sebastian, søren, kasper, jocke,
      and mogens are not playing. IT goes on stoned for a long time but then søren
      plays some of kaspers strange noise devices and congas before moving back to
      the drums for one last jam. We finally after what seems like a long long time
      bring it up beat and Sebastian is back and so is mogens and we have a heavy
      ending jam.. Spaced out.. What a way to end the night. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">1:37</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Now we sit and hear a lot of the pieces and lars is mixing
      some of it down to 2" tape it seems? No, this was a just a test of his
      equipment. We all agree that we have some amazing stuff and it is more stoned
      that we thought it would be. That is what we do, so I am not surprised. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">3:00 I go home and ola and Sebastian are almost asleep
      on the sofa and things are winding down. We meet again at 14:00 to start again
      fresh. A very successful day. I am guessing we have about 75 minutes or more
      of very good material from this first day or recording. </font>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00" size="6">Day 2</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">1:30 I arrive at the MM rehearsal room and all the guys
      are sitting outside gettting fresh air and they had just taken a long walk and
      everyone is feeling great and psyhed up for today. We hang out in the MM rehearsal
      room and SMS Lars... He will be on time, so no problems. We have a little fun
      with a digeridoo, that no one can play quite right but makes great farting noses
      in the large echoy hall and Sebastian sings some swedish folk songs and plays
      the acoustic guitar. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">14:00 Lars arrives and we are all hungry as all the food
      was left in the studio. People go straight for coffee and make some oatmeal
      and sandwiches and we hang out and talk while Søren and Sebastian are
      in warming up, playing for a while. It only takes about 30 mins before the first
      joints are rolled but everyone is ain a super mood and high about what went
      down yesterday and ready to step it up to the next level today! A little blues
      jam is going on with mogens on bass, kasper on congas, soren on drums and sebastian
      on guitar... cool... no being recorded. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">15:00 We are almost ready but Lars is trying to set up
      a few new channels (we have used all 24 that he has and he has to do some special
      rigging to make more than 24 channels (we are the first band to record in his
      studio that has ever needed more!). </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">15:20 Still many problems with getting the grand piano
      mic talkingwith the computer. We have sound into the desk but not into the new
      channels created. Strange problem.. It is really too bad as this first morning
      chill out jam with the grand piano was really really cool and should have been
      recorded. SHit!!!!!!!!!!!!! Magnus is playing the coolest dreamy outerworld
      guitar! Oh well.. what can be done..</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">15:40 Now, we are set to start recording again but with
      out the grand piano channels. We spent almost an hour on this... </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">16:41 We just had a very cool jam that developed into
      two quite heavy parts and it was very hypnotic. IT took the guitars a long time
      to decide to take off but they did. Magnus totally ripped it up while Sebastian
      played all the rhythms. Jocke played awesome bass lines.. as always.... ¨We
      sit and hear 25mins of this jam.. SOund is amazing.. Thanks Lars!</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">18:16 Wow.. THis was the coolest jam that we have ever
      had with a long heavy part at the end and mogens rips off two killer lead synth
      solos. Wow and both guitars were on fire.... but...but..... the fucking ProTools
      shut down and Lars fell asleep, so the last 10 minutes or more of this jam was
      lost.... fuck fuck....we are pretty pissed as it was so amazing..... what the
      fuck can you do.... lets get stoned...</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">18:30 We decide we will have two more jams, one with
      Jocke and the last with Michael .Lars has fixed the software now so that if
      we play longer than an hour it won't shut off..We have recorded a bit over 5
      hrs at this time point. We waste perhaps 30 more minutes as mogens, søren
      and ola are trying to get it figured out how to synch to sørens midiclock
      so the synths will play at the same speed. Did not get it to work, sadly...
      More joints now... and the peace pipe....</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">21:53 Wow... I am totally blown away as I was just transported
      to another galaxy during that last jam as michael played the most amazing bass
      lines and we played heavy, hypnotic and spaced out.. The best combination possible.....
      My head is in another place after that...... That is the end of the session.
      6:53 min put down on 24 tracks...!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes.... 6 hrs and 53 minutes...</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">22:00 SOme of us are sitting with Lars and he has been
      mixing the last two jams down while we play and so we decide to make a rough
      mix of everything now as it is a hassle to not at least have this with us now
      as it takes 74.6 GB of space and Mogens will have to come by with the external
      hard disc and put these files on it so magnus can mix the pieces we decide are
      the best. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">12:15 I am totally wasted tired band have been sitting
      mixing for 2 hrs, now I will go help clean up and pack up my gear, as the recording
      room is pretty much cleared out except for me and mogen's stuff. Looks good.
      Magnus takes over the mixing now. </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">2:00 We are finished with the rough mixes and now will
      burn the jams down to CD. Here is what we have:</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">CD1 Mix 1 12:47, Mix 2 51:04 (Michael)</font>

  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">6 hr 13min</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">I have made some notes of who played bass on what mixes...
      Hope this helps.. it was one of the most amazing weekends. I feel so privledged
      to live in this time and to make music with such wonderful people. We enjoy
      each other company so much and laugh and have a great time but most important,
      we are serious about trying to capture the coolest grooes and music that can
      be made at this moment in time. I think we succeeded and this new material will
      blow peoples minds.... </font>
