<p><strong>Day 4</strong><br>
  <br>
  10:00 We did not get into the apartment until 02:15 and the guy was really sorry. 
  It was their 2 year anniversary and it all got a bit carried away. We left the 
  gear locked in the club so we could load it in the morning. We agreed to meet 
  at the club at 10:30. Still totally gray. No sun for the 4th day. I think the 
  gig last night was very intense. Both guitar players were awesome. Magnus is 
  always amazing. There were some issues with the multitrack recordings though. 
  The high hat mic is missing for two songs of the MM set and they had to replace 
  it. Not a big deal as I am sure you can hear it on some of the other mics. For 
  &Oslash;SC it is a bigger problem though as the kick drum mic died so half the 
  concert it is missing. Unlikely we can do much about that. I am curious how 
  the audience recording is. I just had a shower am pretty relaxed but did not 
  sleep that well compared to the night before.<br>
  <br>
  11:25 We stood outside the club for 45mins for the owner to show up (11:15). 
  It is cold out but we are finally loading up the van and then we will do all 
  this GEMA stuff and have some lunch (breakfast) and hit the road. <br>
  <br>
  12:52 We are finally on a real highway after all these small roads and some 
  construction. We heard the new Hawkwind- Spacehawk CD, which is basically a 
  cool compilation of new and old stuff, different mixes and rerecorded tracks. 
  Pretty cool. We are now hearing the Taylor&#8217;s Universe-Evidence CD again. 
  Good way to easy into the day as people partied pretty hard last night. I think 
  tonight will be the highlight of the tour for sure. Caf&eacute; Cairo is so 
  cool and the crowd at the Psychedelic Network is amazing. A short pee and smoke 
  break and we are on the road again. GPS says 1hr 10mins.. This means we are 
  there about 14 and can maybe hear some of the Papir set! <br>
  <br>
  18:00 Papir played a killer 2hr set and Nik Turner joined them for the last 
  jam. People really seem to like them as well. I have seen them many times but 
  never play for hrs.. Kozmik Klaus&#8217;s visuals are amazing!<br>
  <br>
  20:00 I am a bit stressed as we only have about 1hr to set up all the gear and 
  soundcheck before Mantric Muse and OSC start. Camera played a cool set, very 
  hypnotic stuff. <br>
  <br>
  21:15 Mantric Muse is playing now and it sounds great. Massive huge sound. I 
  am mostly resting up so I can give it all during our show. I have been sharing 
  Nik Turner&#8217;s backstage room where there is a couch that I can lay down 
  on. Sabine gave me a massage as well which really helped me out. I spoke to 
  Nik about a lot of different things and he will come out and join us at 23:00. 
  We talked about the current Hawkwind issues with Dave Brock and himself. It 
  is all pretty sad. I think he wishes they would just call him up and talk to 
  him. Anyway, it is not my business. He is a very nice person. I also chatted 
  a lot with the guitar player from Space Invaders (either Dirk or Tipi). Nice 
  guy. I have talked with a lot of the fans as well and spent a lot of time selling 
  merch, etc.. Awesome festival. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Day 5</strong><br>
  <br>
  What can I say, just a totally amazing festival. I think we played a strange 
  and very spaced out set. Magnus played a lot more synthesizer than at any of 
  the shows, leaving Sebastian alone on the guitar but he was pretty creative. 
  The crowd was into and as usual it took a while but then we really played pretty 
  cool. It was strange when Nik appeared as I did not even see him and then there 
  he was! He played with us for about 50mins, which I think was too long but people 
  seem to like it and said he played his best of the entire festival with us. 
  We will see. It was a bit to short only playing less than 2hrs but that is the 
  way it goes. Anyway.. a great tour and despite my back issues I also had a great 
  time and we are all such good friends for so many years how and playing music 
  together on and off for nearly 10 years. It will be 10 years in April this line 
  up started jamming!<br>
  <br>
  The line up on the tour was: jocke and Michael- bass, Magnus- Guitar and Synths, 
  Sebbe- Guitar, S&oslash;ren- Drums, Ola- synths, Dr. Space- Synths.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks to everyone who came out to see us and bought merch, etc&#8230; See you 
  again one day&#8230; Peace.. A huge and special thanks to SABINE! </p>
