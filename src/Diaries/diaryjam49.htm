<p><strong><font size="3">Saturday March 21st, Helsinki, Finland</font></strong></p>
<p>12:30 I slept like a rock for some hours. Most everyone is awake now. I will 
  need a shower to come back to life for sure and some food. Everyone had a good 
  feeling about the show last night and are excited about tonight as well. Mattias 
  will play the bass with us tonight. We are just having some sandwiches, joints, 
  beers, etc... hearing music. Sebastian and Nick are making some guitar plans 
  and playing a bit. </p>

  and Sebastian playing some guitar! </p>
<p>We will head into town around 15 to go see this Finnish band who is having 
  a CD release party just down the street from where we play in a comic book store. 
</p>
<p>16:45 I bought the Reverend Bizzare/Retho split LP for 9&euro;. The band was 
  pretty strange, krautrock stuff. Pretty hypnotic. Cool bass lines and one stoner 
  like guitar riffing away and one guy torturing his guitar and making strange 
  noises. We saw about 25 minutes and then went up the club. </p>

<p>Before they played I was hanging out with Santtu, Juha at a guy Janne's apartment. 
  He goes to Roadburn as well. IT was a real party lots of joints and beers. We 
  heard some cool music. </p>
<p>17:30 We are setting up the gear. Quite a nice club this one and the people 
  seem nice. A bit bigger stage but we will still have to pull all the drums and 
  my stuff off completely. Kalle is setting up the screens and projectors and 
  stuff for the visuals tonight. IT will look great. People are fresh today, including 
  me. IT will not be that late as we have to stop at 1:00 sharp. Seems that we 
  get no food from the venue, 2.5&euro; beers and free coffee, water and coke. 
  I have set up the merchandise table. We have 4 of our 5 cds still for sale. 
  I wish we had vinyl... We need to have vinyl... I hope for a good crowd. Kalle 
  will video tape the show so that is nice. </p>

  Merchandise Table</p>
<p>18:30 Sound guy is here and we are pretty much set up. He just has to do the 
  mics and we need a check. We will not get any food and have to go out to eat. 
  We have decided on the Thai place on the corner while Mattias and Mogens will 
  go for Pizza. The Taipuva guys are not here yet. IT is nice that there is no 
  smoking in this room, only in the adjacent bar. </p>
<p>21:00 PIB, Nick, Seb and I had some thai curry and are feeling better now. 
  Our soundcheck was fine but then PIB had to take all his drums down and me as 
  well to make room for the Taipuva stuff. My friends Anna and Phil have arrived. 
</p>
<p>1:30 Crazy gig! Taipuva were really great again. Nick and I sat on the floor 
  in the front and just tripped out. Great visuals. Sound was ok up here but back 
  in the room the guitars were quite muddy sounding. The sound guy did not want 
  to put any guitar in the PA, strange.. We had a bad time on stage but I think 
  we played a good gig. PIB could not hear the bass very well and his monitor 
  wasonly white noise. I could not hear Mogens and he could not hear me and then 
  he got himself turned up crazy loud by the sound guy and it blew his montior 
  out and he could hear nothing. This was very distracting for me. I played much 
  better last night. During the last half of th show Nick played this amazing 
  spanish theme and guitar solo. Wow..what a jam... We had a couple of tranced 
  out grooves as well. MOgens is really getting good at this trance groove thing. 
  My friend Mika Jarvanin from the old band 5.15 was at the gig and at the very 
  end, came up and did some spoken word stuff. I was hoping for some real free 
  form stuff but he was just singing lyrics from different songs and not really 
  doing poetry or spoken word stuff.... not as cool as I had hoped. We ended at 
  1:05 or so and played about 90mins. </p>
<p>7:50 I am totally wasted and we are sitting waiting for the ferry here in Turku. 
  I have had no sleep at all. We heard a lot of cool music to keep me awake like 
  Clutch, Pothead, Colorstar...... Everyone is asleep in the van but me. IT was 
  a good trip and the band was well behaved, played great but we need more drivers. 
  This is just too hard for me to have to nearly all the driving and always being 
  totally sober and not allowed to drink a few beers. We will come back to Finland 
  in October.</p>

  Ferry back to Sweden</p>
<p>14:35 We just left Marieholm on the island of &Aring;land. Very beatuiful. 
  I feel really strange but I did get some sleep. I must eat something now. It 
  has been 16 hrs since I last ate anything. I go for the Tapas place again. Not 
  sure where the others are but probably sleeping. Reflecting on the gigs, I had 
  a fantastic time in Hyvink&auml;&auml; but was very distracted in Helsinki because 
  of bad stage sound. The crowd really seem to like us again. This was a better 
  gig than the last one in Helsinki which was too stoned and slow and spacey. 
  Helsinki show was totally different. Finland is great and I hope we can come 
  here 2x a year and build up a following. </p>
<p>15:27 I just got back from taking a Sauna and shower. That is just what I needed. 
  Great. I will lay down for a bit. </p>
<p>19:15 We are on the E4 heading to pick up Seb's car in Mj&ouml;lby. He is driving. 
  We are listning to ZZTOP Mescalaro again. Cool record. Some of the guys met 
  the guys in Soulfly on the ferry just before we were leaving and gave them some 
  hash and got on the guest list for the Copenhagen show this friday, one of the 
  last on their month long Europe tour. Weather is not good for driving fast as 
  it is wet and snow mixed with rain. </p>
<p>2:00 We arrive at Dragens Hule. I think 6 hrs is pretty damn good considering 
  the incredible snow storm in J&ouml;nk&ouml;ping! Have not seen snow like that 
  in 15 years. Insane. We made it though. </p>
