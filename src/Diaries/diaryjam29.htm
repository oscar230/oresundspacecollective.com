<p><strong><font size="4">Session 29- Dragens Hule, K&oslash;benhavn Feb. 9th, 
  2007 </font></strong></p>
<p>I showed up at the Dragens Hule about 17:30 and Kasper and Jesper were eating 
  some food and trying to figure out the PA to make it work optimally. The Swedes 
  were suppose to arrive between 18 and 18:30. I brought all my gear into the 
  club and went up to see if Magnus was around. We went over to his work and got 
  the projector, I put up the screen with the help of Kasper and we cleared the 
  stage area and decided we would use the house mixer and my new one that I got 
  today instead of Mogens mackie mixer. Magnus and I moved down all his gear (now 
  Michael had arrived) and Stefan's gear. THe club was looking good but 18:30, 
  no sign of the swedes. Sent an SMS and they had no even left Sweden yet. 19:30, 
  Tobias, Emil and Ola arrive. Yeah... After a bit of greeting, they set up their 
  stuff quite fast. Mogens had forgot this computer at home and we needed this 
  for the projections, so he and kasper drove tobias's car back to get it. It 
  as not until almost 20 when Kaufmann and Luz (who had a lot of stuff to set 
  up arrived). We wanted to start the show right at 22 as a guy named Steen was 
  to video tape the show but had to leave at around 24 because he lives more than 
  an hours drive away and has to work the next day. Around 22:30, a lot of different 
  people showed up, including G&ouml;ran, Sussane and Micke from Drahk von Trip, 
  Stojs and Per (who both would record the show incase I had problems, which I 
  did not!). It was a tough job to find space for everyone as we had as many as 
  9 playing at the same time on this night. Wow.. We heard some cool music like 
  SEID and Zeitloop while setting up. </p>
<p>Anyway, soon after 22, the place had a lot of people and we started to play. 
  The players on the first set were:<br>
  Stefan- guitar, Tobias- guitar, Thomas- bass, Luz- percussion, Kaufmann- drums, 
  Dr. Space, Ola and Emil all on Synths. Jesper on djembe (not mic'd on the side 
  of the stage)</p>
<p>We played long jams in every set this night. We played a little over an hour 
  in this first set and as we had no time for a soundcheck, there was a lot of 
  trying to get things so everyone could hear each other and adjusting but it 
  seem to work out. I could not concentrate that well to play until the end of 
  the 2nd set as their were a lot of distractions. Anywya, we played some incredibly 
  heavy and groovy stuff.. People were pretty blown away. </p>
<p>We took a short break and had a beer and some a joint and then we changed the 
  members and took off for the 2nd set so Steen could video some of this set as 
  well. I think he got about 20 minutes. I played the My Sleeping Karma CD.</p>
<p>The players on the 2nd set were:<br>
  Stefan- guitar, Magnus- guitar, Michael- bass, Luz- percussion, Kaufmann- drums, 
  Dr. Space, Ola and Emil all on Synths. Sussane- violin, flute and vocals.</p>
<p>This set was one long 75 min jam that had really hypnotic and incredible moments... 
  I was flying totally.... People really seem to enjoy it a lot as well. It was 
  getting louder and louder it seemed to me. People said the sound was good but 
  I never believe them as Magnus was right behind me and I could not hear him 
  at all for the first 30 minutes yet I could hear stefan on the other side of 
  the stage. I finally, after much persistance got him to turn up. We will see 
  if I was right when we hear the recording. Sorry Magnus..</p>
<p>We were pretty drained after this and we took a 45 minute break and hear Antibalas 
  Afrobeat Orchestra. </p>
<p>The players on the 3rd set were:<br>
  Micke - guitar, Magnus- guitar, Tobias- Guitar, Thomas- bass, Luz- percussion, 
  G&ouml;ran- drums, Dr. Space, Ola and Emil all on Synths. Jesper- djembe and 
  vocals. </p>
<p>This set was a total trip and blur for me. I remember parts being cool and 
  also parts where I was not sure what was going on. The groove was damn heavy 
  at times and G&ouml;ran and Thomas really pushing the tempo and the guitarist 
  were totally ripping it up, all three of them. I think there we will be some 
  mindblowing parts amongst the strangeness. I think my synths will be too high 
  at times as I felt like my hearing was going, even though I wore earplugs for 
  all the 2nd and 3rd sets and end of the first as well. </p>
<p>Wow.. we played over 3 hrs of music and still a decent crowd of people left 
  when we finsihed at after 3 in the morhning. A lot of people said it was an 
  amazing show and one guy siad the coolest show he had seen in the last 10 years! 
  Thanks to everyone who came out (peter, rene, anders, john, kim, per, stojs, 
  petter, foxy, tom, detest, nils, anders, etc..) and also to Mogens and Kasper.....awesome 
  party.. </p>
