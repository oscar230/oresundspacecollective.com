        5-6th, 2007</font>
    </strong></p>
  <p>This is the diary for the studio session for what will be our 4th official
    CD release and a nearly totally different line up that we have never had in
    the studio. IT will be exciting!</p>
  <p>11:30 Bought the beer, drinks, food, snacks, and have been practicing the Octave
    CAT and I will pickup KG from the Metro Station in less than an hour. I will
    go meet Thomas and pick up his gear around 15:30.</p>
  <p>14:00 KG and are just haning out and we listened to the Black Tomato CD and
    reading the manual for the Octave Cat. We just ate a big salad and I will leave
    to go get Thomas at 15:00. </p>
  <p>15:30 Picked up Thomas and his bass gear and off to the Black Tornado studio
    and tehn back to get my stuff and KG and his stuff..</p>
  <p>17:06 Lars showed up early and he has a very nice assistant named Fredrik.
    Young guy who has probably never ever heard music like this before. Everything
    is going well with the set up and everyone is in a great mood. I shot a few
    minutes of video of people just hanging out and setting things up. </p>
  <p>17:40 All is setup and the PA is close as well. The first joints are bring
    smoked. </p>

  <p>18:47 The rest of the band arrives from Sweden, ahead of schedule! We are just
    about finished with all the line checks so this is perfect timing!</p>
  <p>19:00 Tobias is setting up and Luz as well. Lars says it is sounding really
    good. No sound in the PA yet..</p>
  <p>20:00 We just finished eating pizzas from Hugos and people are laid back and
    drinking a lot of beers (1st case is nearly gone) and smoking a lot of joints...
    We just need to check the PA and headphones and the Hammond and we are set for
    space rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Some of the song titles people are coming up with:</p>
  <p>PFTKM <br>
    Funny Animal Slippers<br>
    Got a Screw Luz<br>
    Pizza, Beer and THC<br>
    I Vapourized GOD<br>
    Clear Blue Blur<br>
  </p>
  <p>21:00 The jams are about to begin. The pre jam sounded really great. I have
    been filming a little bit. </p>
  <p>22:32 First jam was long, 87 minutes long. Some very cool stuff for sure 3
    or 4 good sections. This jam had Thomas on Bass. We are using 28 channels so
    this will eat up a lot of megabits for sure! People are in a great mood and
    have a good time. More joints and only a few of the 60 beers are left. Will
    for sure need to buy 60 more tomorrow. Poor Mogens has to go to work at 7 in
    the morning and can't make it here before 15-16. </p>
  <p>12:35 AM We just had the 2nd jam of the night and it was 76 minutes long. Jocke
    played the bass on this session. We played some interesting stuff. People are
    really enjojing themselves and feeling well, maybe too well. Stoned and high
    with music as well. All the beers are gone... Interesting that these jams are
    not that spacey, really funky, jazzy, salsa, whatever you want to call it. We
    hear some of the rough mixes and they sound pretty good, drums are perhaps a
    bit high. Hope for some even better jamming tomorrow! </p>
  <p>1:40 KG, Thomas and I leave.. The others will all crash at Magnus's place downstairs
    from the studio. </p>
  <p>My overall feelings about Day 1: PIB and LUZ play really well together and
    so do Tobias and KG but we don't really all stick into the grooves that long
    together as the old band. Thomas played really killer bass in the first session
    of the day. Jocke, he also has a great smooth groove when he plays. Mogens was
    really played great synth and hammond as well but he seems to get distracted
    sometimes when he has a killer synth line going and we could just all really
    fly on it and then he drops out..... As for me, I think I got some cool sounds
    out of the CAT and did ok but I hate the delay sound that I have. IT is much
    better with the effect from my small mixer but it was peaking out and we were
    worried about distortion in my channel so we did not use it. </p>
  <p>
    <font size="5"><strong>Day 2</strong></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size="3">9:50 Ijust got back from returning the beer bottles and buying
      two more cases of beer and some more snacks. The weather is amazing just like
      yesterday. I watched some of the video from yesterday and it is great. Magnus
      filmed about 25 minutes of one of the jams. Really nice. A lot of excellent
      pictures on my camera from yesterday. I took most of them but Magnus also took
      some (the ones you can see me in!) 35 minutes of video total. Some studio shit
      as well. </font>
  </p>
  <p>12:30 Magnus, Tobias, Luz and Jocke come over to my place and we have juice,
    sandwiches, coffee and tea and then take a walk to the beach for some fresh
    air. Great day. Everyone is feeling really good and had a good time yesterday.
  </p>
  <p>14:35 We have been sitting in the sun in my yard listening to music and having
    a beer and a joint. Hear the new Hungarian bands, Sonar and Flyjam. People are
    digging it.</p>
  <p>15:10 We are back at the studio now and KG is setting up the sitar in the control
    room with two mics and we will start with a chill out jam with the sitar and
    see how that goes. We will run it through the PA so we can all hear it and he
    will hear us through the studio monitors in the control room. Have to make sure
    everyone shuts up.. IT is Tobias, Thomas, me, Luz and PIB on this first jam.
    Mogens is delayed and can't make it for another hour. </p>
  <p>17:00 WOW::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::.. The sitar
    jam was totally amazing. A short 15 minute one and then a long 35 minute jam
    that was totally amazing.. The sitar has such a cool sound and KG is fucking
    good...................... I filmed KG playing the last 5 minutes of the jam.
    Mogens showed up at the end and plays a little bit. </p>
  <p>17:20 A piano jazz jam starts with PIB, jocke and mogens on the grand piano.
    Then KG joins on the organ as well...</p>
  <p>18:50 Wow.. everyone slowly joined in, me and Tobias and this was quite cool
    with Mogens on grand piano to start and later his synths while KG was playing
    really awesome Hammond organ. I think this jam was a bit over and hour. </p>
  <p>19:40 We plan to try to rock out a bit more and Thomas adds teh Big Muff to
    his bass set up. We all just finished eating pizza again from a different place
    (not as good as the night before and almost all the pizza orders were wrong.
    I think Magnus had an old menu card or there was really bad communication. Mogens
    is very tired. Michael, our old bass player, just showed up. While Thomas and
    I went to get the pizza's Magnus, Mogens and PIB (on hammond)had a synth freakout
    session... 22 mins recorded</p>
  <p>21:33 The jamming continues but you can see that the joints and beers (he only
    has a few) are catching up on PIB as he is getting tired in his playing, as
    are everyone I think. IT was just too much party today again and we can't play
    well. Tobias and I have given up on this long jam. THe last 20 minutes is without
    guitars and KG on Hammond again. I don't think we get much out of this jam at
    all. We should perhaps stop now... Jam was 81 minutes. </p>
  <p>I got everyone to introduce themselves on the video camera.. Fun...</p>
  <p>22:15. We decide to go for one more jam with the sitar again to close out session
    37. </p>
  <p>23:07 The last sitar jam was not good. We were playing in minor and KG in major
    so he stopped us and then in the end Lars and Magnus had not given him a good
    enough sound so he could not play the way he wanted to so this was not good
    enough but it was still fun...</p>
  <p>Now, we have to pack down all the gear and help to clean up as another band
    uses the studio tomorrow. About 7hrs recorded and 80GB of data that lars will
    transfer to our Hard disc overnight and give to Magnus. </p>
  <p>01:00 KG and I have our stuff packed up in my car and the others have all moved
    the gear out and are just hanging out on the sofas in the studio and finished
    the last beers and joints before calling it a day. I think everyone had a really
    great time.. Let's see what kind of new OSC sound will come out of these sessions...
