&Oslash;resund Space Collective: West, Space and Love / Phaze Your Fears<br>
Space Rock Productions (005 / 006) </strong> 
<p> Here we have two latest vinyl releases by Danish-Swedish instrumental improvisational 
  space/psych/kraut band OSC. I guess our readers are already familiar with these 
  guys since they have also played at our club on several occasions. It&#8217;s 
  really great that the band now has a record label of their own to release their 
  stuff and there also plans to release material by other groups</p>
<p>The Phaze Your Fears vinyl is just about to be released and includes two long 
  jams recorded in 2010. It&#8217;s from the same sessions that also gave us the 
  Entering into the Space Country album so you know also this stuff recorded during 
  the first day of the sessions is killer material. The rather groovy &#8221;Phaze 
  Your Fears&#8221; rocks in a hypnotic way and more psychedelic layers are added 
  along the way. After a more serene phase the band is turned on into playing 
  a bit harder space boogie towards the end, and things work out very smoothly! 
  The over 24-minute &#8220;Ear Meat&#8221; still is my favorite of the two tracks 
  since it really melts your mind even more effectively! There is a really hallucinatory, 
  experimental part in the middle where they have dubbed in some heavily manipulated 
  narration in Russian&#8230; This is great space rock in the spirit of Hawkwind 
  and Ozric Tentacles but in a style of its own. Once again, an excellent release 
  by this amazing band. There will be 500 copies pressed of this album and the 
  cover art is by Ed Unitsky whose art we have seen on some previous OSC albums 
  too. Recommended!</p>
