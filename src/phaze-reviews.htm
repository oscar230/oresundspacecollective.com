    Øresund Space Collective: West, Space and Love / Phaze Your Fears<br>
    Space Rock Productions (005 / 006) </strong>
  <p> Here we have two latest vinyl releases by Danish-Swedish instrumental improvisational
    space/psych/kraut band OSC. I guess our readers are already familiar with these
    guys since they have also played at our club on several occasions. It’s
    really great that the band now has a record label of their own to release their
    stuff and there also plans to release material by other groups</p>
  <p>The Phaze Your Fears vinyl is just about to be released and includes two long
    jams recorded in 2010. It’s from the same sessions that also gave us the
    Entering into the Space Country album so you know also this stuff recorded during
    the first day of the sessions is killer material. The rather groovy ”Phaze
    Your Fears” rocks in a hypnotic way and more psychedelic layers are added
    along the way. After a more serene phase the band is turned on into playing
    a bit harder space boogie towards the end, and things work out very smoothly!
    The over 24-minute “Ear Meat” still is my favorite of the two tracks
    since it really melts your mind even more effectively! There is a really hallucinatory,
    experimental part in the middle where they have dubbed in some heavily manipulated
    narration in Russian… This is great space rock in the spirit of Hawkwind
    and Ozric Tentacles but in a style of its own. Once again, an excellent release
    by this amazing band. There will be 500 copies pressed of this album and the
    cover art is by Ed Unitsky whose art we have seen on some previous OSC albums
    too. Recommended!</p>
