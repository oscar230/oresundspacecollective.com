  <p>8:00 IT is saturday monring OCt 10th. KG and Love from the Stockholm band,
    Siena Root arrived last night at 01:00 on the train. We did not spend much time
    chatting as we had all worked that day and were tried. We would have a busy
    day tomorrow (today).KG brought his sitar, some mics, and effects pedals and
    Love, some hand drums. Mogens, Magnus and Thomas are all suppose to come over
    today. The Swiss band <a href="http://ww.gingerspace.com">Ginger</a> are playing
    tonight in Dragens Hule so we will try to get as much done as possible. The
    point of this recording session is to make some more jams with sitar for the
    next Dan MCGuire spoken word CD, in which he will us a lot of OSC sitar music
    on. I think it will be great. He just does not have enough to make a full CD.
  </p>
  <p>11:00 The gyus are up. CLotho had left so she did not get to see them this
    time. We will eat some food and get busy setting stuff up right away. </p>

  <p>15:00 We have had 3 jams now (14, 18 and 11 minutes long). The 2nd one had
    a long beginning and not much was happening. The 3rd jam, we wll felt the beginning
    was really good. Love switched from the spring drum to the hand drum. Mogens
    called and his neck is bothering him so he will not come. Thomas never got back
    to me so I assume he is not going to come and play some bass. </p>
  <p>16:00 We have recorded like 6 pieces now and we have decided to try to program
    some drones on the OSCar and NOrd Lead as this is easier for the sitar to have
    a rhythm. Magnus is not coming now, so it will just be the 3 of us. Instead
    of OSC, it is is really West, Space and Love, this session. </p>
  <p>16:50 We just recorded a very very cool jam with the bass rhythm provided by
    the OScar and I just modulated as it went along. I also used a bit of the kaosscialtor
    as well. THis was jam 8 and about 15 minutes long. </p>
  <p>20:00 We did a few more jams and I made some vegitarian pasta and we had some
    beers. Everyone is feeling fine and thinks we are doing cooler stuff now. Sone
    11 has KG playing the acoustic guitar. This was very good. </p>
  <p>Song 13 is one of our favorites. KG plays some killer electric guitar and I
    did a very cool solo on the Kaosscilator tuned to sound like a sitar. We are
    finished for the day now and will head out to Dragens Hule for the Ginger concert.</p>

    </strong></p>
  <p>11:45 We are all very tired. We got home at 03.00 oin the morning. The GInger
    concert was great. Man, they really jam and rip it up, SOme great blues and
    psych rock. We will not record a lot more today, I don't think. </p>
  <p>14:30 We just did an overdub of the tambourine on the Jam 13 and we had recorded
    two more short jams this morning. Love on acoustic guitar, KG on Sitar and me
    one some drones. </p>
  <p>16:00 THe guys head off to the train. I burned all the jams, 9GB of files for
    KG so he can do some mixing on it in Cubase at his home. I now need to make
    some rough mixes for you all to hear and to figure out what is the best stuff.
