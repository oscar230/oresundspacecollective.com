    <font color="#FFFF00">It is snowing like a monster outside and I am waiting
      at the rehearsal room at 2:30 in the afternoon. Everyone is late.. but not that
      late. I am listening to the Allman Brothers from Mansfield, MA August 2004 as
      the snow builds up on the car. IT is quite windy and we have to drive across
      the bridge to Sweden and I am hoping they don't close the bridge. Anyway, the
      Swedes are calling and give me directions to get to the place so they don't
      have to meet us. It is a new rehearsal space. After everyone shows up (Michael,
      Mogens and Magnus), they smoke a joint and we load the car and we are off. IT
      is a very slow and careful drive as the roads are really nasty. We finally arrive
      at like 5 in the afternoon. I drop them off and we go pick up Kaufmann and all
      his drums at his rehearsal room and then it is finally about 6:30 and we are
      nearly set up for the first jam now. Phew.... We got a lot of food (tomatoes,
      cucumber, bread, cheese, peppers) and a lot of beer as well. The room is long
      and skinny and I am set up at one end and Ola and Mogens at the other. The sound
      test tells us that it is going to be loud and sharp in the room . All the synth
      player are having trouble hearing what we are playing. We rearrange the PA a
      little. </font>

    <font color="#FFFF00">Wow.. people are really stoned today... but the music
      is really amazing... I forgot my headphones so we have no way to check if the
      placement of the microphones is any good for recording in this room. I hope
      so.....</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Jam #1 is about 45 minutes long and jam 2 about 42 minutes
      long. The grooves are really cool and pretty far out at times. Especially the
      stuff in Jam #2. Seems people are losing focus a bit. More joints and beers..
      wow..... I have to drive back to denmark so nothing for me....</font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font color="#FFFF00">Jam #3 is the best one for sure and also the most stoned.
      I thought we were finished as we all hang out for some fresh air and talk for
      a while but a few want to play a laid back piece to finish the night. Mogens
      and Michael are finished.. ears are hurting.... THis turns out the amazing piece,
      Sunrise, one of the coolest things we have ever played. Enjoy.....</font>
